       " 'One of the first 1999 Cabs on the market, this wine smells and tastes like the grapes were crushed yesterday. This is what middleweight Cabernet Sauvignon sans oak tastes like: all fresh blackberries and cherries, with undercurrants of espresso and sweet spice. A remarkably tasty wine that should be easy to find: There were 65,000 cases produced.',\n",

       " 'More than three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, the balance is Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with just pinches of Sangiovese (2%) and Zinfandel (1%), it plays on the savory and green end of the Cabernet spectrum, with notes of green olive and dried herbs along with cherry and chocolate and a tingly, gritty feel.',\n",
       " \"The curve on this wine has been going up and up, and this '09 is their best yet. It's bone dry and savory in acids, with ultraclean citrus, mineral and white flower flavors. Just delicious as a cocktail sipper.\",\n",
       " 'Too sweet, with a sugary finish that tastes like lemonade and pineapple juice.',\n",
       " 'This wine has all the necessary smoothness, plus deep plum and cherry flavors and touches of spicy oak, too. The texture feels layered and the fruit components are vivid and tasty. It all comes together gracefully on the palate and the finish.',\n",
       " 'Aromas of this wine convey notes of roasted corn on the cob, popcorn and peach. The stone-fruit flavors are sweet and easygoing.',\n",

       " 'Ripe, fruity and tannic, this shows lusty flavors of cherry and raspberry jam that finish sweet and spicy. The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Zinfandel.',\n",
       " 'This unbaked wine in a can tastes a bit tired, but it has an earthy appeal. The color is a brownish red and the aromas seem dusty and mature. The flavors are beefy and peppery while the texture is nicely tannic.',\n",
       " \"Lifted cherry, mango and peach aromas lend a slightly candied note to this slightly off-dry rosé made from Cabernet Franc. It's unabashedly juicy and fruity on the palate, but balanced with brisk acidity. A fun, easy-drinking sip.\",\n",

       " 'This is an herbal Merlot that tastes of toasty oak and finishes slightly sweet.',\n",
       " 'These vineyards seem to have been selected for unripe, vegetal grapes. Just manages to scrape by with a veneer of cherries.',\n",
       " 'Quite sweet and fruity, with honeyed, candied stone fruit flavors. The residual sugar is listed as 6%, which qualifies this as a late-harvest style, and it would fit nicely alongside a simple dessert of fresh peaches and butter cookies.',\n",
       " 'Aromas like dried herbs and flavors like green apple and pear nectar make a colorful combination in this medium-bodied wine.',\n",
       " \"Apple cider, night jasmine, ripe pears and orange cream aromas show on this sweeter bottling. The palate is quite clean and crisp, with rich apple juice flavors and a tactile acidity that fades fairly quickly. It's quite sweet.\",\n",

       " 'This is an aromatic, sweet smelling Riesling with notes of ripe peach and honeysuckle. Though labeled as dry, at 1.86% residual sugar it drinks almost medium-sweet. Misdirection aside, it provides good value.',\n",

       " 'Semisweet it is, with 12.2% alcohol and 30 g/L residual sugar. Lightly scented with bath powder, lavender and rose petal aromas, this brings on citrus and peach fruit, with a bit of phenolic bite carrying the finish.',\n",
       " \"Vanilla and butter touches give this medium-bodied, rather oaky wine extra richness. Its soft, creamy texture and muted fruit flavors are a bit unusual for the type, but it's still quite enjoyable to sip.\",\n",
       " \"Cecchetti Wine Company makes a lot of Line 39 Sauvignon Blanc, but does it well, offering an affordable wine that tastes great. Grassy and tropical, it's true to Lake County, with just a touch of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc character. Crisp and easy to drink.\",\n",
       " 'Sugary sweet and soft, with candied flavors of cherries and berries.',\n",
       " 'Modest citrus, earth and almond notes come up from the glass, and continue in the flavors of this smooth, rounded, and straightforward wine. The balance is on the soft side, and the body is quite light.',\n",
       " \"This is soft and lightly scented with citrus. Aromas of lemon peel precede light flavors of citrus and green apple. It's a simple, quaffable white wine, with a bit of Riesling and Viognier in the blend.\",\n",
       " 'This series of wines, under the Badger Mountain label of Powers winery, uses grapes that are organically grown. Minimal sulfites are added. This a fresh, forward, deliciously fruity Chardonnay, loaded with a classy mix of apple, pear and peach fruit. A great springtime sipper.',\n",

       " 'The aromas are quite faint here but the apricot flavors are in abundance on this off-dry, medium-bodied easy drinker.',\n",
       " 'A 100%-organic Chardonnay, stainless steel fermented and poured into a handy-dandy, also certified-organic AstraPouch (1.5 liter). This easy-to-bring-on-a-picnic wine is clean, balanced and simply drinkable with a note of sweet grapefruit and pineapple.',\n",
       " 'Ripe and very dry, this has flavors of raisins, blackberries and dark chocolate, with a hint of smoky oak that adds richness.',\n",
       " \"Concord grapes are unmistakable for their sweet, high-toned Welch's grape jelly aromas and flavors. The Bella Rosa stays true to this bright, juicy, easy-drinking style. It's not a complex wine but delightfully quaffable.\",\n",
       " \"Something seems off here, or perhaps it is just a young wine throwing off some bottling aromas. In any event, it's thin, simple and sugary, without the complexity of the excellent 2010.\",\n",
       " 'A good buy in a dry, full-bodied red wine. Clean and balanced, with jammy flavors of plums, earth and blackberry, it has well-etched and accessible tannins, a rich mouthfeel, and a spicy finish. Value.',\n",
       " 'This kitchen sink-style blend has aromas of baking spice, dark plum and herb. It drinks off dry, with smooth currant and plum flavors that linger.',\n",
       " \"This wine starts slowly, but a little bit of air really loosens it up, yielding aromas of vegetable oil, apples, and spring flowers. In the mouth, it's light in body yet crisply flavored, with Granny Smiths dominating. Enough floral elements persist on the palate to provide moderate complexity.\",\n",
       " 'Full bodied and viscous on the palate, the wine is balanced by bright acidity that gives it good focus. Peach, grapefruit, apple and spice notes are at the core here, followed by a lemony fresh finish. Quite fruity in style and fairly sweet. Try it as an aperitif or with duck and sweet sauces.',\n",
       " 'Raised in stainless steel, without oak infuence, this wine is rich, savory and dry. A small percentage of Pinot Grigio brings a note of green apple to the flavors of citrus, white flower and honey.',\n",
       " \"Lovely and fresh, this piles on flavors of Bosc pear, with the texture to match. It's a wonderful expression of the grape coming from the eastern Washington region, accented with lovely, delicate baking spices.\",\n",
       " 'Sugared plum, spice, vanilla and herb aromas are followed by off-dry, soft blue-fruit flavors in this wine. It provides easy-drinking pleasure.',\n",
       " \"This great-value SB from Lake County hits it out of the park on all sorts of fronts, including price. It's got subtle aromatics of pear and lemon, and is a little generic and simple, but at $10 it's so perfectly drinkable who cares? All in a colorful package. Best Buy.\",\n",
       " 'Soft and simple, but the price makes it a pretty good value. Shows cherry, violet, cocoa and smoky oak flavors in a smooth package that finishes dry and spicy.',\n",
       " 'Savory rather than simply fruity flavors are the strong point of this medium-bodied and well-balanced wine. It tastes almost like melon wrapped in prosciutto as meaty, earthy nuances blend with modest fruit accents.',\n",
       " 'Raw and fresh, with jammy mulberry, blackberry and pepper flavors. A rustic wine for rustic food.',\n",
       " 'Simple and silky, this is fairly sweet in apricot and raspberry fruit. This is easy to drink at picnics and similar everyday occasions.',\n",
       " 'Tasty touches of toasted oak, butter and almonds in the aroma and again in the flavor add depth to the ripe Anjou pear notes in this full-bodied, posh-textured wine. With all that flavor, it keeps its balance and has a lingering finish, too.',\n",
       " \"Dry and gritty, with rugged tannins and lots of acidity. Unfortunately, the fruit just isn't powerful enough to stand up to it, making this Merlot tough to like.\",\n",
