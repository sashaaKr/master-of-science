       " \"Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.\",\n",
       " 'Soft, supple plum envelopes an oaky structure in this Cabernet, supported by 15% Merlot. Coffee and chocolate complete the picture, finishing strong at the end, resulting in a value-priced wine of attractive flavor and immediate accessibility.',\n",
       " 'Slightly reduced, this wine offers a chalky, tannic backbone to an otherwise juicy explosion of rich black cherry, the whole accented throughout by firm oak and cigar box.',\n",
       " 'Building on 150 years and six generations of winemaking tradition, the winery trends toward a leaner style, with the classic California buttercream aroma cut by tart green apple. In this good everyday sipping wine, flavors that range from pear to barely ripe pineapple prove approachable but not distinctive.',\n",
       " 'Red fruit aromas pervade on the nose, with cigar box and menthol notes riding in the back. The palate is slightly restrained on entry, but opens up to riper notes of cherry and plum specked with crushed pepper. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc is approachable now and ready to be enjoyed.',\n",
       " 'Ripe aromas of dark berries mingle with ample notes of black pepper, toasted vanilla and dusty tobacco. The palate is oak-driven in nature, but notes of tart red currant shine through, offering a bit of levity.',\n",
       " 'A sleek mix of tart berry, stem and herb, along with a hint of oak and chocolate, this is a fair value in a widely available, drink-now Oregon Pinot. The wine oak-aged for six months, whether in neutral or re-staved is not indicated.',\n",
       " 'This wine from the Geneseo district offers aromas of sour plums and just enough cigar box to tempt the nose. The flavors are a bit flat at first, then the acidity and tension of sour cherries emerges in the midpalate, bolstered by some black licorice.',\n",
       " 'Oak and earth intermingle around robust aromas of wet forest floor in this vineyard-designated Pinot that hails from a high-elevation site. Small in production, it offers intense, full-bodied raspberry and blackberry steeped in smoky spice and smooth texture.',\n",
       " 'Clarksburg is becoming a haven for Chenin Blanc in California. This bottling, using fruit sourced from several vineyards in the area, is balanced with just a trace of sweetness in the background (1% residual sugar). This is crisp, straightforward and blessed with notes of pear and lime. Drink it cold.',\n",

       " \"The clean, brisk mouthfeel gives this slightly oaked Sauvignon Blanc instant likeability. It's dry with a rich streak of honey that sweetens the citrus, pear and tropical fruit flavors. Pair this with Asian fare, ham or a green salad with grapefruit sections.\",\n",
       " 'Right out of the starting blocks this is an oaky wine, dripping with caramel and vanilla notes. The texture on the midpalate is finessed and graceful, with drying tannins that latch onto the oak-driven finish. An eccentric blend of 50% Tannat, 35% Petit Verdot and 15% Pinotage.',\n",
       " 'This is a sweet wine with flavors of white sugar, orange, honey and vanilla, all brightened by crisp acidity.',\n",
       " 'This bottling resembles the New Zealand paradigm of Sauvignon Blanc, bearing aromas of grapefruit, passion fruit and kiwi; a sprinkling of graham cracker adds interest. The wine hits the palate like a fleshy fist, with an intense, grassy gooseberry flavor that provides plenty of punch. Pair with apricot-glazed roasted chicken.',\n",
       " \"This shows jelly-like flavors of orange and pear, with some earthy tones. The mouthfeel is soft and there's a bounty of oak in the form of buttered toast and caramel notes.\",\n",
       " 'This is weighty, creamy and medium to full in body. It has plenty of lime and pear flavors, plus slight brown sugar and vanilla notes.',\n",
       " 'Aromas of cranberry, barrel spice and herb are followed by tart cranberry flavors with grainy tannins. It falls a bit flat and the variety seems hard to discern.',\n",

       " 'A blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this wine brings disjointed lightly volatile aromas of wood spice, vanilla and cherry. The plump cherry flavors are rounded out by woody barrel notes.',\n",
       " \"Very deep in color and spicy-smoky in flavor, this full-bodied wine is packed with dark-fruit flavors like blackberry and blueberry. Aromas like grilled beef and spicy flavors like cardamom and smoke give it a bold character that's hard to deny.\",\n",
       " 'Aromas of vanilla, char and toast lead to light creamy stone fruit and canned-corn flavors. It provides appeal but the oak seems overweighted.',\n",

       " \"Juicy plum, raspberry and pencil lead lead the way in this vineyard designate, a site that's 2,000 feet high. Tobacco and cedar meet a full-bodied hit of oak and puckering tannin, the wine still youthfully wrapped in its full-bodied boldness.\",\n",
       " \"This is the producer's first release of this wine. Fruity aromas of plum and tart cranberry add to its overall sense of lightness and understatement.\",\n",
       " 'This is made from equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with small additions of Malbec. Juicy, it reveals a raisiny quality of ripeness around integrated oak and generous tannin.',\n",

Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices.

       " \"Smoky aromas and a bold apricot flavor give this dry and seemingly light-bodied wine a distinct personality. Fermented in small concrete egg-shaped vats, it's far from simple and fruity, and instead offers great acidity and a tangy, tempting, appetizing personality.\",\n",
       " \"Blended from all five Bordeaux varieties, with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot almost equal in proportion, this is a lovely, well-crafted wine, softly concentrated with highlights of licorice, lavender, violets and black pepper. From three ranches farmed by the family, it's both seamless and structured.\",\n",
       " 'This wine is a blend of fruit from five different vineyards scattered across the valley. The aromas of barrel spice, black cherry, dried leaves, herbs and flowers still seem quite locked up. The flavors are generous and full with palate coating milk chocolate and cherry flavors with a finish that lingers.',\n",
       " \"Voluptuous blackberry and plum flavors are edged by hints of bitter coffee and spice in this richly bodied wine. Fringed by a bare feather of tannins, it's luscious in mouthfeel, with an unctuousness that persists luxuriously on the palate.\",\n",
       " 'Berry crumble and licorice star in this full-bodied, hearty and smooth wine, blended with 4% Petite Sirah. Spicy oak and milk chocolate unleash further flavor and spice on the finish.',\n",
       " 'Fresh blueberry and grape aromas meet with black plum, asphalt and turned earth on the nose of this bottling by Steve Dooley of Stephen Ross Cellars. Fresh blackberry juice, black pepper and dill show on the palate that is coated with decent acidity and a good tannic structure.',\n",
       " \"Fine acidity and a bracing minerality, like a lick of cold steel on a winter day, mark this Chardonnay. It has oak notes, but they're wisely kept in the background, allowing the citrus, green apple and peach flavors to star. This beautiful wine continues the winery's string of great reserve Chardonnays, and is their best since the 2006 vintage.\",\n",
       " \"Thickly moussed, Roederer's Brut, 60% Chardonnay blended with 40% Pinot Noir, aged two years on yeast is affordable and luxurious. A gorgeous, very dry sparkling wine with aromatics of honey, raisin, apple and pear, it is rich and soft and offers both depth and length. It's an ideal marriage of bright acidity and ripe fruit character.\",\n",
       " \"With a wine this finely constructed, the question is always ageability. There's no question about the immediate deliciousness. It's thrilling with raspberries, strawberries, orange rind and cola, and complex notes of minerals and earth. The mouthfeel is absolutely beautiful, comprised of silk and satin brightened with acidity. So should you drink it now? Yes. Will it age? For the next six years, yes.\",\n",
       " 'Proving that exceptional wines can be (and were) made in this cool, light vintage, this estate-grown selection is both elegant and complex. Flavors of mixed wild berries, a streak of tea, a whiff of peach and compelling balance carry it through an extended finish.',\n",
       " 'A marvelous Pinot Blanc, this combines aromatic hints of almond with mixed citrus fruit and rind, zippy acidity and a great wash of minerality. It cleanses and tickles the palate, lingering sensuously through a finish of surprising depth.',\n",
       " 'Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and bramble—one almost wants to say thistle—wrapped around taut, compact black fruits. There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade.',\n",
       " \"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon was grown in the well-known Beckstoffer Georges III Vineyard. It's at a funny stage of development, with primary cherry and blackberry fruit starting to fade, while sage, dill, green olive and dried fruit notes are emerging. The tannins remain robust, while the acidity is just about perfect for Napa Valley. Awkward now, but with a promising future, it should emerge from the doldrums after 2017.\",\n",
       " \"This is a big wine, clearly in need of cellaring. There's a massive core of blackberries, cherries and baking chocolate on the palate, but it's rigidly tannic, dry and acidic still. The blend is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 15% Sangiovese, putting it in the super Tuscan category. Give it until 2017 to begin to mellow, and it could still be going strong in 2025.\",\n",
       " 'This Stella Mae is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc. It remains a rather lean wine in the Sparkman portfolio, despite having alcohol at 14.6%. Here are lightly earthy flavors of strawberry and herb, with a hint of green in the tannins.',\n",
       " \"The alcohol is nice and low in this dry Pinot Noir. It has a silky texture and complex flavors of red cherries, persimmons, cola and spices. Acidity is great but there's something slightly off, suggesting a trace of unripeness. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"This smooth, lush Cabernet is brimming with blackberry, black currant, blueberry cedar and spice flavors. It's classic Cabernet. You'll find quite a scour of acidity running through the middle, which suggests this wine should pair with rich, fatty meats.\",\n",
       " 'Tart and lively, this medium-bodied Sangiovese was co-fermented with small amounts of Syrah and Viognier. The Viognier contributes scents of citrus and stone fruit, which add some welcome complexity.',\n",
       " 'Produced by Three Rivers for celebrity winemaker Geoff Tate, the Insania is actually rather tame. Pretty fruit flavors of berry, cherry and plum introduce the wine gracefully, then run into some stiff, drying, chalky tannins.',\n",
       " \"This is intensely aromatic, with loads of tropical fruit, apple blossom and white peach notes on the nose and palate. It's fresh, tasty and big in body, yet deftly balanced. Soft, lemony acidity on the midpalate gets a boost of citrus rind and saline on the finish.\",\n",
       " 'This El Dorado wine opens with aromas of sweet floral jasmine and is very pretty through and through. Its acidity sings perfectly through the middle of the wine, lifting the flavors of apple and dried apricot as well as the notes of lemon and lime on the finish. This should pair with a range of midweek dinners.',\n",
       " \"This wine has the variety's trademark notes of herb, green bell pepper, with a woodsy qulaity. This is a full-bodied effort, bearing a long, spicy finish.\",\n",

       " \"Sauvignon Blanc has been a consistent performer for Hanna, usually yielding a rich, ripe wine with brisk acidity. The '11 is one of their best efforts. It's tart, clean and savory, with the pineapple, tangerine and Meyer lemon flavors touched with a slight sweetness.\",\n",
       " 'Medium bodied, this sharply defined wine brings in plenty of notes of herb, root and earth around its light berry fruit. It captures the defining flavors of Wahluke Slope Syrah in a somewhat muted style, reflecting the abbreviated growing season.',\n",
       " 'This is a mix of fruit from both warm and cool vineyards, crafting a clean, fresh, lightly herbal wine with a pleasing dusty character. Hints of cocoa and toast annotate the tart berry fruit, with a thread of smoke and chalk running through the tannins.',\n",
       " \"This would be a straightforward Bordeaux red blend if not for the 5% Petite Sirah within. Together, it's 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec as well, sourced from Howell Mountain and valley floor sites. Dusty and herbal, the wine is thick and sizably tannic, with dense black fruit, leather and coffee.\",\n",
       " 'Flint and smoke aromas show strongly on this bottling, alongside hints of lemon balm and a rustic apple cider vinegar savory kick. Tangy smoked tangerine flavors show on the energized sip, where a unique sandalwood smoky quality plays with more cider-like tang.',\n",
       " 'Big tannins support the layers of extracted, concentrated fruit that leans red into cherry, cassis and currant. Char and vanilla speak for the oak.',\n",
       " 'Delicate in cranberry and strawberry, this wine is highlighted in uplifted acidity and plenty of length and breadth within its medium-bodied structure. A pleasing streak of cardamom is consistent throughout, as accents of forest floor and cola figure in.',\n",
       " 'This is a relatively thick and dense wine, grippy in tannin and oak at first, youthful and desiring of time and air. Beyond its strength, its shows the beginnings of delicacy and grace, commingling raspberry with clove and tea.',\n",
       " \"This is a soft, smooth and earthy wine, still unraveling from its youth, that's crisp and fresh in acidity. Chewy still in texture, it offers a glorious celebration of red cherry, rhubarb, tea and clove.\",\n",
       " 'Deliciously fruity but also well-structured, this full-bodied wine has excellent concentration and good balance. Effusive aromas of blueberry and black cherry lead to opulent but not overripe berry flavors that are lightly accented by clove and cinnamon nuances.',\n",
       " 'Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff.',\n",
       " 'This is a delicate yet flavorful take on this grape, from a biodynamic, cool-climate vineyard. Light red plum and hibiscus aromas meet with sweet herbs and cinnamon spice on the nose. The lithe palate offers candied strawberry with thyme, anise and touches of garden herbs, with that red fruit flavor carrying deep into the finish. Would pair great with spicy food.',\n",
       " \"The Sims is amped up in 2014, dark and thick and showing a roasted character. Mocha, black tea and Kahlua flavors push the palate into a gritty charred mode. It's delicious, liquorous, and suitable for smoky ribs or a juicy burger. Drink now through 2020.\",\n",
       " \"There's a whiff of volatility upon opening, then a rush of bright, tangy orange and cherry fruit. The 20% new oak aging does not really come through in scent or flavor. Though not in any way effervescent, this young release carries an impression of carbonation in the finish. Give it another year or two of bottle age and drink after 2019.\",\n",
       " 'Wood spice, cherry and herb aromas are followed by luscious cherry flavors. It keeps you coming back for more with a high yum factor.',\n",
       " \"There's an expert balance between lightly melted butter, pithy Meyer lemon and toasted marcona almond on the nose of this bottling from the region's iconic vineyard. The palate is wound up tightly, offering good grip and lots of textural length while showing flavors of chamomile, saffron, sea salt and more Meyer lemon rinds.\",\n",
       " 'Just 8% of this reserve spent time in new oak, putting the emphasis on juicy jammy flavors of cranberry fruit. It rolls into sour cherry, some citrus and a most refreshing, clean and vivid mouthfeel. Drink now and into the mid-2020s.',\n",
       " \"From the sought-after site on Westside Road, this wine delivers a nuanced, elegant expression of juicy red cherry, plum, pomegranate and light, compelling spice. With a depth of body and soft, integrated tannin, it's complex without being overpowering, finishing in a mix of sautéed mushroom and forest floor.\",\n",
       " 'One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully. The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least.',\n",
       " 'Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) consults here. This brings a blend of clones from the estate vineyard, with ample new wood still showing through. Black fruits and a vein of coffee are also in the mix, with a balanced, somewhat muscular mouthfeel. This has the strength to stand up to a lightly blackened grilled seafood filet.',\n",
       " 'Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through. Give it a good decanting and it will start to smooth out.',\n",
       " 'Black plum, charred wood, coffee syrup and cracked black pepper show on the excellently bright nose of this bottling. The flavors are equally intriguing, with umami touches of charred beef along with rosemary, bay leaf, olie and more black pepper.',\n",
       " 'Merlot (63%) takes the lead on this blend followed by Cabernet Sauvignon (23%) and Cabernet Franc. The aromas seem somewhat wound up at present, with notes of wood spice, vanilla and fresh herb. The palate is über-smooth, showing a fine sense of balance and polish.',\n",
       " 'A 100% varietal wine, this offers upfront structure and gravelly texture, its tannins robust. The medium-bodied ripeness allows plenty of room for dried herb and cedar, accents to the bolder notions of black raspberry jam and coffee.',\n",
       " \"This is sourced from 30-year-old Wädenswil vines from a vineyard in the Elkton AVA. It's complex and compelling, showing layers of stone, strawberry, citrus, chocolate and sassafras. It's an elegant wine, well proportioned and modest in scope, but delicious.\",\n",
       " \"Bright pomegranate and dried strawberry notes start the aromas on this bottling and then descend into more brooding cola, smoked herbs, cinnamon and spicy hibiscus. There is herbal and mineral depth to the palate, with raspberry, cranberry and pencil lead flavors that evolve toward fruit punch, thyme and earth. It's light in body but full of grippy texture.\",\n",
       " 'A touch of earthy funk shows at first on the nose of this bottling, laced throughout the dark cranberry, pomegranate, crushed grapeseeds and a lavish layer of violets. The palate is heavily spiced with clove, gingerbread, a touch of juniper, lots of earthy sagebrush and a strong cranberry fruit, all seasoned by an iron-powered minerality.',\n",
       " 'From one of the more exciting and westernmost vineyards in the region, this bottling shows earthy, gamey aromas alongside ripe red and purple fruits, pairing plum and black cherry with minty, musky herbs. The palate shows dried olive, tart orange peels, red plums, baked figs and pine needles, proving deliciously savory and intense.',\n",
       " 'Strong elements of black pepper and smoky oak beg for steak to be paired with this 100% varietal wine. It showcases sizable weight and a solid tannic structure, with supple expressions of black cherry and chocolate that linger long on the rich finish. This bold beauty should hold well through 2023.',\n",
       " \"From Paso's blending vanguards, this mix of 62% Syrah, 19% Petite Sirah, 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Malbec offers an intriguing nose of sesame, soy, cracked pepper, fresh blackberry and raw beef. There is cedar and toasted pine on the palate as well as smoked meats, black pepper, teriyaki and an elderberry-blackberry base.\",\n",
       " \"This is a gorgeous wine, blended with 8% Merlot, 1% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec, and aged entirely in new French oak. Juicy waves of cassis and red currant are accented by dark chocolate, ultimately showcasing a lush, plush yet structured palate. It's decadent now, but should age well through 2022.\",\n",
       " \"Crisp green apple is the star in this well-made, balanced and elegant wine, that's tangy yet smooth, with a voluptuous tease of anise. Approachably structured, the complexity of the texture and lurking layers of further flavor suggest letting this wine open slowly to unveil its true self, and allowing it to linger on the palate.\",\n",
       " 'Deep aromas of dried strawberries and blueberries meet with hot bricks, dried meats, purple flowers, a touch of smoke and secondary notes of truffle on the nose of this delicious smelling and tasting wine. The layers of flavor on the palate range from black cherry to milk chocolate, framed by chalky tannins.',\n",
       " \"This is the producer's highest and most westerly vineyard site. It holds back from the start, still tightly wound and somewhat reduced on the nose. As it opens, ethereal layers of wild strawberry, green tea and lacings of herb and white pepper unveil to tremendous effect.\",\n",
       " \"The estate-grown grapes for this wine come from some of the appellation's highest-elevation sites, at the base of Mount Veeder. Natural acidity is the star of the show, a nice surprise after a decadent honeyed color and bouquet. Serious texture and complexity give way to a touch of salted caramel and peach.\",\n",
       " 'From the gorgeous, mighty Pagani, planted in 1895, comes this powerfully rich and refined wine, a study in woodsy rusticity and layers of fig, blackberry and a stick of cinnamon. Full bodied and luxurious on the palate, a lithe jolt of acidity rears its head just before the finish, trying to compete with the licorice and leather. Drink now through 2020.',\n",
       " 'Discovery Vineyard Cab makes up most of this wine, with just a splash of Champoux vineyard Franc to fill it out. Very pretty, very focused aromas of spice box, red and black fruit and herb are followed by a fruit-forward, shamelessly appealing yet still elegant, balanced palate that puts a premium on purity, with a well integrated structure surrounding it all.',\n",
       " \"Winemaker Dennis Martin puts grape grower Stephen Miller's signature on this wine, a nod to the importance of this historic vineyard.

Earthy sagebrush and wild herb flavors frame the palate, where cooked cherries and cranberries are spiced by cardamom and dried ginger spice.\",\n",
       " \"It's fun to rattle off a few of the numerous aromas and flavors in this exotic but subtle wine: tangerine, pastry cream, blanched almonds and a touch of honey. The wine is refreshing, dry and nicely braced with acidity, but at the same time rather broad and soothing in texture. In other words, beautifully balanced and wonderfully complex.\",\n",
       " \"This mostly Syrah blends in 6% Grenache, combining the two grapes from the property's estate into an opaque, juicy expression of black licorice, tar, cigar, grilled mushrooms atop a meaty steak and plenty of black pepper. Big and bold in every sense of the word, it retains just enough acidity to maintain an inviting nature and beguiling floral backbone.\",\n",
       " 'As the name makes clear, this wine is made from a head-pruned, older block of very unlikely Syrah at the estate property, as seductive as rare. Plum, black cherry, leather and black pepper jump from the glass, slowly and with purpose, around a core of burly tannin and intensely floral aromatics. This is a great wine.',\n",
       " \"In the big, ripe and saturated school of winemaking, this wine has a deep color, oodles of black cherry and blackberry flavors and full body.

       " \"This is big boisterous wine from Elias Fernandez and Doug Shafer that has been given some nice time in bottle after four years in new French oak.

       " 'Spicy cracked peppercorns, light tar, fresh picked lavender and light purple fruits show on the savory nose of this bottling. More strong pepper notes show on the palate, as do tart elderberries, sesame, soy and hoisin elements, with a nice smoked meat character adding to the delicious complexity.',\n",
       " \"There's magic in this 65% Petit Verdot and 35% Sangiovese combination. This shows concentrated cherry and kirsch aromas, touches of shiitake and porcini mushrooms and plenty of turned, wet earth aromas.

       " 'Softened by 6% Merlot, this lovely concoction opens with a waft of smoky cigar box, becoming a bold, loud expression of the variety dotted in classic notes of cassis and cedar. A luxuriously velvety texture is the standout, though, supported by great structure and length.',\n",

Not only is the finish lingering, but the wine still tasted great two days after pulling the cork.\",\n",
       " \"This cuvée is made with the oldest Pommard clones in the estate vineyard. It's a sharp-edged, reserve-level wine with a defining streak of peppery herb. The black fruits and barrel flavors of licorice, espresso and dark chocolate promise further depth as it ages. Drink 2020–2030.\",\n",
       " \"This full-bodied wine has a voluptuous entry that's slightly tropical in pineapple and Asian pear, as well as vanilla-layered oak. The expansive beginning segues smoothly into a higher-wire act of minerality, finishing fleshy and fresh.\",\n",

       " 'Livelier than usual in texture and popping with bright citrus aromas and flavors, this light-bodied and barrel-fermented wine is a great palate-cleanser and will pair beautifully with dishes like raw oysters and herbed goat cheese. It smells and tastes like lemon, lime, green apple and kiwi, and has great balance.',\n",

It's softly tannic, with pronounced jolts of tobacco and black pepper. With small amounts of other Rhône varieties, from Syrah to Viognier, it meanders to the finish, with a distinct trace of minerality.\",\n",
       " \"Similarly to it's Virgin Berry sibling, Roth's regular label Dry Riesling has a distinctly green, woodsy tone lending an alpine feel to sweet-tart peach and apricot flavors. It's brisk and fine-footed, yet zesty tangerine and grapefruit acidity persist long on the finish.\",\n",

       " 'A big burly Syrah from this Temecula producer whose goal it is to become the premier winery of Southern California, the wine is loaded with plummy black fruit and a peppery mouthfeel, its oakiness derived from the almost three years it spent barrel-aging in new French oak. Not for the meek at 15.6% alcohol, it finishes a tad sweet.',\n",
       " \"The blackberry, blueberry, bacon, pepper and sandalwood flavors are nice, and the wine finishes dry. A good, rich Syrah for drinking now if you're looking for a full-bodied and tannic red wine. Give it a brief decant.\",\n",

       " \"The Lorna Marie is the winery's reserve, and it has exceptional concentration and depth. Berry and cherry dominate, spiced up with a pumpkin pie accent. Round, rich and full, yet moderate in alcohol, this is a fine expression of Oregon Pinot Noir in a challenging vintage.\",\n",
       " 'All the 2010 Patton Valley Pinots are significantly lower in alcohol than the previous vintage, and it works to their advantage. Nuanced fruit flavors include rhubarb and tart cherry, with veins of cola and dark chocolate adding further complexity. Its length is excellent.',\n",

Complex and long, this is a wine that will surely spark some heated discussion.',\n",

       " 'Made entirely from Syrah grown on its property across multiple vintages, and then cave-aged six years in American oak, this is a nice dessert wine, raisiny and brimming in Christmas spice. With plenty of body and acidity, it swims effortlessly and smoothly on the palate, a bite of decadence that will work well with rich cheeses.',\n",
       " \"Aromas of savory herbs, mineral, exotic spice and red fruit are followed by fruit flavors that are surprisingly restrained considering the warmth of the vintage. Tart acidity livens it up. It's green for the variety but still brings enjoyment.\",\n",
       " 'The aromas of mineral, spice, toast, yellow apple and lemon pith are light but enchanting. The palate is medium bodied and refined, demonstrating judicious use of oak and a lengthy finish that shows some warmth.',\n",
       " 'Bone dry and replete with skin flavors of pear and grapefruit pith, this is perfect for those who want to keep their alcohol consumption down without turning to a sweeter style of wine. Try it with grilled sausages and sauerkraut.',\n",
       " \"Very smooth, almost thick, this is a rich wine in flavor and mouthfeel. It practically oozes over the palate, dripping with ripe pineapple, vanilla and cream, and coats every corner of the mouth before lingering through a long finish. It's full bodied, soft and concentrated.\",\n",
       " 'This wine opens with a confectionary nose, slowly unleashing its thick, concentrated richness of dark cherry and cassis on the palate. Between the layers are grippy tannins and shakes of meaty leather and black pepper. This could stand some time in a decanter or swirling in the glass before enjoying.',\n",
       " 'This is a particularly expressive wine with lots of personality. It opens with aromas of cherry, tea and wood smoke, and tastes very dry and structured with vivid fruit acidity and tannins. Sour cherry and raspberry provide the fruit flavors.',\n",

       " \"Grape soda, prune, leather, graphite, dust and black tobacco blend into an intriguing nose on this estate Malbec from Paso's Eastside.

       " 'This is a highly structured wine with an abundance of fine-grained tannins and firm acidity to support pure raspberry and blackberry flavors. It tastes as if it was made for aging, so wait and drink after 2019.',\n",
       " \"This new “i” series offering mixes brambly strawberry fruit with granular tannins. It's ready to drink, dappled with cinnamon, and leaves a slightly medicinal aftertaste in the back of the mouth.\",\n",
       " 'Full-bodied and smooth in texture, this generous-tasting wine has lots of ripe plum flavors and sweet-seeming oak accents.',\n",
       " 'The great Ritchie Vineyard, a renowned site for Chardonnay, also possesses highly sought-after Sauvignon Blanc. Here, it shows as grassy in pea shoots and thick, with a voluptuous texture and body weight.',\n",

       " 'Sweet in jammy apricots and pineapples, with even richer notes of smoky vanilla and buttered toast. Crisp acidity fortunately provides some balance. From Venge Vineyards.',\n",
       " 'A bit earthy and herbal, and soft, with cherry and cocoa fruit flavors. The acidity and tannin structure could be firmer.',\n",

       " \"This is a classic, high-acid vintage. The strength is fruit, and it's a mix of citrus and light pineapple; all stainless fermented and finished at moderate alcohol. Quite different in style from the '06, but well-made.\",\n",
       " \"Good price for a crisp white wine that's this polished. Nice on its own for the savory citrus, spearmint and spicy vanilla flavors, and fine with everything from fried chicken to Cantonese.\",\n",
       " \"Rich in the mouth, this creamy and textural wine mixes fruit flavors of peach, apple and pear in equal proportion. It's a bit heavier than the previous vintage, with less of the floral character, but it offers, instead, a richness that lingers into a satisfying finish.\",\n",

       " \"Arcane's Cab is stylistically apart from either California or Washington. It defines its own space. There's plenty of new oak, but the fruit, acid and tannins stand up to it. This is sharp and tangy; cranberry and raspberry, strawberry and citric acids all playing their part. Still young, give it some time in a decanter or in your cellar to come together and show its best.\",\n",
       " 'Aromas of cherry, spice and mint lead into tart pie cherry and wild berry fruit, dusted with cocoa and spiced up with 16 months in French oak barrels. Unusual for most high-end Pinots, this is sealed with a screwcap.',\n",
       " 'This bold, expressive Pinot Noir bursts open with spice, herb and leaf then rolls into flavors of vanilla cream and tangy red fruits. The spicy elements wrap into all the other flavors, giving lift and life; this is an exciting wine, though not necessarily one to cellar.',\n",
       " \"This is a very interesting wine. It has many different flavor threads that have not quite interwoven. To begin there is a surplus of acid, leaving a chalky sensation that has not yet smoothed out. The fruit flavors are also sharp and tart—red fruits from wild berries to pomegranate to sour cherry. The aromas suggest some light chocolate from the barrel aging, and it shows up in the finish, along with herb and vanilla. So, there's lots going on, but it has not yet come together in a harmonious whole.\",\n",
       " 'Unusually fruity for a Pinot Gris, this bursts with quince, hay and lanolin aromas that give way to an intense palate with good weight. While slightly astringent, the mouthwatering finish will provide a good foil for fried calamari.',\n",
       " 'This blend from a newer Westside Paso winery offers blackberry, charred pine and sour cherry aromas. The palate is driven by pine sap, charred game and sharp herbs such as oregano and rosemary, and would be a great way to spice up a steak dinner.',\n",
       " 'A nice tarry funk along with dried mint and menthol cigarette scents characterize the nose of this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Syrah and 4% Petite Verdot. The creosote sense carries to the palate, meeting with black cherry, dried bouquet garni and quite grippy tannins.',\n",
       " 'Estate bottled, this assemblage of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot opens with a flurry of coconut flake and herb, followed by ripe, rich layers of dark berry and black tea. The wine has power yet also possesses an elegance that stands out, finishing with a taste of dark caramel.',\n",
       " 'Creamy and fresh, this is made from estate-grown grapes, fermented in a mix of stainless steel and neutral barrels. The fruit flavors blend jicama, melon and pear, with a touch of sweetness. It finishes with a hint of honeysuckle.',\n",
       " 'This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting. Aromas include pressed kiwi and a sour pucker of lime, and the broiled pear flavors prove easy drinking, if not exceedingly complex.',\n",
       " \"Smooth-drinking, this offers soft, mellow flavors of melon and pear. Light but persistent, it's a clean, fresh and appealing selection, best enjoyed now.\",\n",
       " 'The pretty fruit flavors suggest relatively young vines, bringing light cherry to the front and center. Hints of marzipan, a flash of finishing heat and subtle chalkiness run through the finish. Another year or two of bottle age should continue to improve this one.',\n",

       " 'Sea salt, Bosc pear, apple cider, squeezed lemon and shreds of vanilla frame a leaner nose on this wine from mid-Monterey County. The cider element carries to the rather pungent palate, proving quite high-toned and acidic with some minerality, grapefruit peel grip and long-lasting vibrancy on the finish.',\n",
       " \"This wine offers notes of toasted vanilla bean, herbs and red fruit. It's broad in feel while the fruit flavors are elegant in style, with the supple feel bringing much of the enjoyment.\",\n",
       " \"Far and away the freshest and most interesting of the three vintages submitted for review. The fruit retains more of its youthful gloss; it's riper and shows more cherry character, along with bright, spicy highlights. The tannins are proportionate and less earthy and herbal. This is no barn-burner, but it's a good quaffer.\",\n",
       " 'This is a pretty good buy for a Merlot that shows lots of polish and sophistication. It has savory black cherry, currant, cola and spice flavors. The tannins are a little rugged and green, so it loses some points.',\n",
       " 'Shows plenty of lush, ripe fruit, wrapped in soft tannins and balanced with crisp acids. The forward black cherry, red licorice, orange and smoky vanilla flavors are rich, and the price makes it a great value.',\n",
       " \"Estancia produces solid, savory Pinot Grigios at a fair price, and they even dropped their price last year. This one's a little off-dry, with crisp acidity and pleasant citrus, peach and honeysuckle flavors.\",\n",
       " \"This is the kind of wine someone serves at a big party, maybe in paper cups, along with the canapes, and you're delighted because it's actually pretty good. It's dry, soft and chocolaty, with a rich undertow of blackberries and currants.\",\n",
       " 'Composed, complex and complete, this mellow wine is very comfortable in its skin. Touches of oak, tobacco, dried plum and cardamom fill the aroma, and ripe but not overripe black cherry, tamarind and cola flavors flood the palate, supported by fine-grained tannins and medium-full body.',\n",
       " 'This wine offers astounding quality for the price, a juicy expression of fruit and spice with a depth of firm resolved tannin, lively acidity and layers of black cherry and cola. Approachable and delicious, it hits the mark on every level being light bodied and refreshingly balanced while complex.',\n",
       " \"With its distinctive black label, this reserve is set apart from the winery's expanding lineup of Pinots. It shows more oak-derived flavors, along with ripe plum and cherry fruit. Streaks of espresso, vanilla and chocolate come through, suggesting it will only improve with a hearty decant or additional bottle age. Drink now through the mid-2020s.\",\n",
       " \"Sourced from the estate's original 1999 plantings, this is a chewy, majestic, earthy and deeply dark wine. Its black fruit is ribbed wtih iron, licorice, coffee and graphite notes and framed by earthy tannins that lend texture. It drinks bigger than its listed alcohol would suggest.\",\n",
       " 'This single vineyard wine is a blend of six separate blocks, each planted to a different clone. It deftly combines savory herb flavors with ripe Bing cherry fruit. The tannins are polished, textured and balanced, leading into a long finish that leaves a final impression of composted earth.',\n",
       " 'Always impressive in its grasp of power and grace, this white is memorable from start to finish, beginning with a dark golden-hay color that dazzles in the glass. A strong floral component of jasmine invites on the nose, while sparkling acidity maintains a freshness amidst the integrated oak and delicious flavors of honeyed pear and crème brûlée.',\n",
       " 'Irresistably delicious and reminiscent of cru Burgundy, this laser-focused effort features bright Meyer lemon, tangerine and peach flavors, with plenty of juicy acidity. It grows deeper and richer as it breathes—and seems to disappear way too quickly once opened.',\n",
       " \"This winery is earning a place among Oregon's best with its top tier wines, like this one. Complex and loaded with bee pollen, crisp apple, lime zest, seabreeze and toasted cracker notes, it leaves you breathless the longer it breathes.\",\n",
       " \"As characterful as the dry version but with lower alcohol and a slight hint of sweetness, this boasts powerful tangerine, quince and Meyer lemon fruit. Its electric acidity keeps it vivid and beautifully balanced. Delicious now, it's also cellar-worthy.\",\n",
       " 'More tart than sweet, this delicious wine is packed with lemon drop, candied pineapple and tangerine fruit. The acidity is in perfect proportion with the slightly sweet palate, giving it a vivid mouthfeel that extends into the finish and offers versatility for food pairing.',\n",
       " \"Lighter in color, this wine is aromatic and expressive, with notes of fire pit, blood, black olive tapenade, sea salt, black pepper, cured meat, nori, crushed flowers and umami. The palate brings soft, lithe, focused notes of earth and savory flavors that shimmer on the salty finish. It's all about delicacy but the aroma and flavor expression is compelling. Give it some time in the cellar or decant.\",\n",
       " 'Estate-grown, this 100% varietal wine impresses in its total embrace of succulent blackberry, plum and mocha goodness, built upon a mountain of structured tannin and quiet oak. Touches of milk chocolate play along the palate as it rides along a velvety roadway, finishing soft and silky.',\n",
       " 'From dry-farmed 40-year-old vines perched along the Rutherford Bench, this impressive offering is sanguine and elegantly balanced, a showcase of cranberry, raspberry and milk chocolate. Refined acidity contributes to an overall lightness, with dried herb and dust lingering on the finish.',\n",
       " \"All Trisaetum's dry Rieslings feel a notch riper in this warm year, to good effect. Meticulous blending of individual lots, some aged in oak, brings layers of complexity and helps differentiate each cuvée. Concentrated pear, peach and papaya flavors are on display here, with tangy acidity and superb length and richness. It's dry, to be sure, but also brilliantly fruity.\",\n",
       " 'Smoky, with bursts of sage and celery root, this is a wine that is unabashedly earthy, spicy, bold and juicy at its core. Light-bodied and delicate, the palate shows beautiful floral undertones. This is a complex and beguiling bottling that should hold well for years to come.',\n",
       " \"The aromas of this wine leap from the glass, with notes of orange peel, potpourri, smoked meat, spice, fresh herb, stem, ash and plum. It's expressive, but still wound up. The flavors are focused, concentrated and savory, bringing a sense of intensity and richness but also lightness. The balance is exquisite.\",\n",
       " 'This is an impressively well-crafted, and beautiful wine, blended with 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Malbec, the main variety mountain-grown on Pritchard Hill. It shines in big, bold and powerfully built black fruit and leather. Dusty, firm tannins and a taste of graphite, coffee and tar are also highly evident. The finish is tart and seasoned in white pepper. Best enjoyed 2023 through 2033.',\n",
       " 'From a three-acre spot known to get a hearty dose of fog, this wine speaks to cool-climate character, unveiling crisp floral layers of dried sage and white pepper from the get-go. Those aspects are joined by rose, lavender and cranberry-rhubarb on the palate, finishing with subtle offerings of mushroom and forest floor.',\n",
       " 'From vines planted in 1976, this aromatic wine shows the depth that old vines can bring. Strawberry, cola, butter (from 14 months in 50% new French oak), wild cherry and more come into focus, and although delicate, they last and last on the palate. The finish is spectacular.',\n",
       " \"This reserve-level wine from the Roserock vineyard, Domaine Drouhin's recent Eola-Amity Hills planting, is compelling. Dense and fragrant, it boasts a beguiling mix of rose, cocoa powder and Asian spice, like a magic carpet ride of flavor. A finishing note of chocolate-covered orange peel is the pièce de résistance.\",\n",
       " \"The winery shows its prowess with making delicious, affordable larger-production wines with this bright and easy drinking Cabernet, a study in soft tannins, juicy cranberry/currant fruit and composed structure. It's a good one to stock up on at the price and quality.\",\n",
       " 'This super-smooth late harvest effort is perfectly balanced among sugar/alcohol/acid components. Lively and rich, it offers concentrated flavors of limoncello, apricot and candied peaches. Drink it chilled for best effect.',\n",
       " 'Creamy and well-integrated, this offers personality and style. The crisp bite of green apple and lemon curd are textured and long-lasting. With its overall balance, it is a fantastically versatile pairing option.',\n",
       " 'With the scent of watermelon chapstick leading the way, this is a fruit-forward wine you want to kiss. Other aromas on the sweet-and-spicy nose include stewed plums and a dill-led herbal element. The flavors of red fruits and brown spice make for a completely delicious experience.',\n",
       " \"There's a ying-yang of rich crème brûlée, lemon curd and toasted oak amid good acidity and fresh apple and pear fruit, with inviting aromas to boot. Creamy and crisp it'll serve well aside all manner of seafood, like fresh-caught trout.\",\n",
       " 'With alcohol in the low-moderate range, this immaculately fresh wine is flush with juicy gooseberry and grapefruit. It carries the varietal hallmarks of fresh herbs, notably chive, and a balancing lick of minerality.',\n",
       " \"Boushey and Red Willow are the vineyards that contribute to this 100% varietal Cabernet Franc. There's excellent concentration to the brambly, bright, blackberry fruit, and some sharp acidity to underscore it. It's pure varietal and should continue to improve 2019–2021.\",\n",
       " 'Fresh, gushing fruit flavors such as raspberry, red cherry and boysenberry fill out this expressive and well-balanced wine. It is sweetly fruity in aroma, full-flavored, full-bodied, firm and dry in texture but not heavy. It craves ribs or wood-fired pizza.',\n",
       " 'Distinct crushed lava rock aromas meet with dust, cinnamon, cola and Dr Pepper on this blend of 28% Syrah, 22% Grenache, 17% Cinsault, 17% Mourvèdre and 16% Carignane. Light red fruits of cranberry and slight strawberry show on the palate that dives into serious tannins quickly.',\n",
       " \"Coming from the warm 2013 vintage, this is an aromatic offering, with notes of pineapple, kiwi, herbs and oak spices (40% barrel fermented). It's creamy in feel, but with tart, vibrant acidity that keeps the palate fresh and lively.\",\n",
       " \"One of a string of great values made at Terravant near Santa Barbara. Attractively oaky, it's full-bodied, full-flavored and just tannic enough to make it a good pairing for rich meat or cheese courses. It is deep in color, with a slightly tawny rim. It smells like wood smoke and grilled bread, tastes deep as blackberry and delivers cherry flavors that linger on the finish.\",\n",
       " 'Rich cherry and spicy black pepper introduce the nose to this wine from the Adelaida district. The flavors explore the more nuanced, not overly jammy side of the grape, with tart acidity and a good tannic backbone ensuring a long life. Decent now, but better to drink 2018–2022.',\n",
       " \"While ebulliently peachy and floral on the nose, savory notes of dried reeds and savory herbs overwhelm the fruit flavors in this dry, light-bodied Riesling. It's crisp and refreshingly composed, but finishes a bit short. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"Red apple, spice and honey aromas lead to medium-sweet fruit flavors. It brings some appeal but the concentration doesn't seem all there.\",\n",
       " 'This wine is an unusual blend of Touriga (38%), Tinto Cão (20%), Tempranillo (18%), Petit Verdot (15%) and Souzão. Alcohol aromas show prominently along with dark fruit. The fruit flavors seem dried out, juxtaposed by the sweetness of the wine, with the tannins having a real sense of grip.',\n",
       " 'This wine is tightly wound and thickly colored. Full bodied in style, it shows plenty of oak influence, aged in entirely French oak for 16 months, 42% of it new. Cranberry and sour cherry dominate in terms of fruit, with an underlying agenda of clove and tea.',\n",
       " 'This is a challenging mix of substantially puckering tannins and herbaceous notes, dotted in black peppercorns. The fruit is elusive.',\n",
       " 'This Zinfandel-dominant blend also contains Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah in sizable amounts, rounded out by a handful of Merlot. Relatively light bodied, it has a muted nose. The flavors lean towards overripe, more dried fruit than fresh.',\n",
       " \"An uncomplicated combination of red and black berry bramble with an overlay of coconut shavings provides a ripeness of fruit atop sweetened tannins and dull oak in this wine. It's made to be medium bodied and enjoyable now.\",\n",
       " \"Pronounced notes of butter, cheese and canned cream corn dominate this savory Chardonnay. It's a rather fat, cream-textured wine but sunny tangerine acidity and fresher notes of apple and pear flavors do get a peek through the midpalate.\",\n",
       " \"Aromas like green apples and lemons, and herbal flavors make this wine refreshing and balanced toward the lean side. It's rather light bodied and crisp in texture.\",\n",
       " 'After 34 months in previously used French barrels, this wine has a brownish rim. It smells like pepper, clove and cinnamon and tastes like dried fruit. Considerable tannins contribute to an astringent mouthfeel.',\n",
       " 'This Meritage is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Tasting quite ripe, it has a burnt sage and cedar undertone. Tannins hit on the back of the palate with power and not much finesse.',\n",
       " \"The aromas of cinnamon, kelp, and dried fruit are unusual and don't seem in harmony. The gamy flavors bring some appeal but don't entirely come together.\",\n",
       " \"Coffee grinds and caramel mingle with hints of popcorn and dried herbs in this curious blend of white grapes which have been aged Sherry-style in a solera. Whiffs of dried fruit and caramel are enticing, but the palate juxtaposes craggy acidity with mouthfeel that's dampening and flat.\",\n",
       " 'This is spicy and sharp, with high-toned fruit flavors of berry and currant. Acids are strong and provide good focus, with a spicy/peppery note resonating through the finish.',\n",
       " \"Old vine Petite Sirah fortified with brandy in the Port style, this very sweet wine could benefit from some time in the bottle. It's quite rich in chocolate, black currant and spice flavors wrapped into smooth, thick tannins, with a burn of alcohol on the finish.\",\n",
       " 'From Gallo, a two-county blend with some real elegance and style. The Cab is dry, soft and full-bodied, with lingering blackberry, currant, licorice and spice flavors. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"With its peppery spices and briary, brambly notes of ripe wild berries, this wine tastes more like Zinfandel than Merlot. It's not true to the variety, but it is a solid red wine, dry and full-bodied.\",\n",
       " \"In keeping with the winery's other red wine releases, the Cedarosa matches tart berry fruits to lush barrel flavors of butter and toast. It's approachable and somewhat monolithic.\",\n",
       " 'A little heavy and ripe for a Pinot Noir, this bottling shows pie-filling flavors of cherries, blackberries and currants, with a candied chocolate-covered mint sweetness. It also seems overly soft. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"Stemmler's record is spotty with this bottling. This '05 is a little too ripe, soft and heavy, but the chocolate-inspired red currant, cola and licorice flavors are lip-smackingly good.\",\n",
       " 'Honeylike aromas, ripe peach and apple flavors and rather full body give this wine good depth and breadth. It seems like just the thing for a picnic or to serve with cheese at a party.',\n",
       " 'Crisp green-apple freshness blends with hints of butter and vanilla for a nicely balanced, un-oaky, medium-bodied wine at a very reasonable price.',\n",
       " 'Though aged in neutral oak, this wine opens with scents and flavor hints of toast and butter. The fruit is clean and generic, like a fresh apple, but the mouthfeel lacks life and fades into a flat finish. Drink up.',\n",
       " \"There's a solid concentration of red and black berries to the nose of this wine, with tar and soy sauce giving depth. Solid tannic grip on the palate offers support to the array of dark cherry and blackberry alongside sandalwood and smoke.\",\n",
       " 'This wine is very good in a ripe, almost-sweet style. It smells and tastes like blackberry pie, has full fruit flavors and a smooth, rich texture without noticeable tannins.',\n",
       " \"There's a touch (17%) of new oak here, which adds flavors of caramel and vanilla to the rather tart and simple fruit. It falls into the generic yellow/green apple style, with hints of arugula.\",\n",
       " 'This is an assertive, flavorful and robust wine, with a medium to full body, a mouthfilling texture and fine-beaded bubbles. A creamy viscosity and wonderful layers of butter, apple, vanilla and ginger make for a delicious palate.',\n",
       " 'Black in color, this heavy concentrated wine is thick in black pepper and clove, with underlying streaks of cedar. Well structured, it unfurls depths of black cherry, currant and vanilla as it develops in the glass, finishing a full bodied as it started.',\n",
       " \"This blend works in commingling 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Franc and 4% each of Malbec and Petit Verdot, all from the producer's vineyard. Caramel sparks a richness against which herbal, woody tannins speak. The body expansive and full, and the finish awash in spicy clove.\",\n",
       " 'Dark purple flowers and tart boysenberry paste show on the nose of this intensely concentrated wine, alongside pencil shavings, bay lead and a lot of iron minerality. More bay leaf and pine needle show on the herbally full and texturally grippy palate, giving minty spice to the dark fruit flavors.',\n",
       " 'Dark and deep aromas of black cherry, clove, allspice, black pepper and char make for a hearty impression on this appellation blend. The palate is also rich and powerful, its thick mouthfeel showing black cherry, cocoa, vanilla and a touch of asphalt. A rocky minerality and minty finish complete the experience.',\n",
       " 'Complex and composed, this vineyard-designate wine is brightly decorated in flavors of grapefruit pith and lemon zest, with zippy acidity. As it develops in the glass, richer elements of peach and apricot flesh out the palate with succulent aplomb.',\n",
       " \"From the Barton family's estate vineyard, this is a very dark Syrah with aromas of blackberry, balsamic, lavender and thyme flowers. There's a rich blueberry flavor at the core of the palate, where cocoa shavings, tense tannins and a lilac florals combine for a multi-layered wine.\",\n",
       " \"Scott Sampler's experimentation with extra long macerations seem to imbue even more of a sense of place to his wines. In this case, that translates to very purple aromas of grape Jolly Ranchers, violet oil and warm black licorice.

       " \"Lilacs and wisteria combine for a floral and approachable nose in this clonal study, which is also loaded with clove, peppercorn, rosemary and elderberry aromas. It's soft and lush on the palate, with rich plum and black cherry flavors leveled by notes of anise, potpourri, fresh mint and Earl Grey tea.\",\n",
       " 'Extremely lively peppercorn aromas meet with black plum, blackberry, dried violets and lavender on the nose of this bottling by vineyard manager Ruben Solorzano. The palate is spicy with cracked pepper, rosemary oil and pine needles, which mix with the blackberry and elderberry fruits. Roasted lamb flavors also make an appearance against tannins that rise up in the finish.',\n",
       " 'After three years en tirage, this well-evolved wine is heady and floral, made to highlight and celebrate diversity. Creamy and lush on the palate, it has a rounded richness of stone fruit. Made predominantly from Pinot Noir, it has an accentuated taste of strawberry shortcake.',\n",
       " 'What a treat to find a great rendition of this rare varietal. Concentrated black-fruit flavors pair beautifully with aromatic oak accents in this bold and complex wine. It has plenty of tannins to support the intense blackberry and blueberry flavors, while enticing cinnamon, cumin and leather come up in the aroma and last through the lingering finish.',\n",
       " 'Dark gold in color, a strong note of apple skin gives way to tight acidity on the entry of this wine. As it develops in the glass, it becomes plush and fleshy, imparting complex elements of candied quince and orange blossom.',\n",
       " \"Marc Piro continued to hone his craft under Jim Clendenen at Au Bon Climat, and that expertise shows in this bottling, which combines Presqu'ile and Bien Nacido Vineyards to produce a wine that's both zesty in the underripe style yet full of fruit as well. Aromas of wild oregano, thyme, tapenade and red cherry lead into a palate full of tantalizing acidity, with tart Montmorency cherry, tangy tomato and fennel spice.\",\n",
       " \"This elegant bottling by two service-industry veterans shows tons of potpourri, dried lavender, black raspberry and red plum on the nose. The flavors are quite broad and inviting, with hibiscus and ripe tomato meshing into juniper and clove. It's light in mouthfeel and weight, but well structured.\",\n",
       " 'Elegant and beautiful aromas of Montmorency cherry, tart orange peel and balsamic fig reduction sauce prove precise and show some mature vine age. Roasted fig flavors meet with salt and pepper seasonings on the palate, which is well structure and full of bright acidity.',\n",
       " 'Extreme concentration combined with a velvety texture make this inky-dark wine made from Tannat and Dornfelder compelling to taste. The color is black with a thin ruby rim while black cherry, cedar and tobacco fill the aroma and crème de cassis meets espresso on the palate. The mouthfeel is polished as very fine-grained tannins blend with a rich viscosity.',\n",
       " 'From the Carneros-based producer with its roots in Spain, this succeeds in its velvety smooth texture, juicy fruit and supportive acidity. Black licorice and spiced plum are given additional richness by a jolt of dark chocolate.',\n",

       " 'Very roasted notes of coffee, warm leather, tobacco leaves, sagebrush and stewed blackberries show on the nose of this blend of 70% Tempranillo, 20% Grenache and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon.

       " \"Here is a solid, widely distributed, well-priced, all-purpose Chardonnay. It's got plenty of buttery toast, soft and round fruit—lightly peachy—and unusual richness for a wine in this price range. It's a California style with a Washington twist—real acid.\",\n",
       " \"Tasted at the age of 38 months, Erba's Bordeaux blend is a dense, tannicly dry wine. It has well-ripened flavors of blackberries, currants, mocha and cedar. If you drink it now, decant. Best before 2011, before the fruit falls out.\",\n",
       " 'A polished, supple Cabernet with real class and style. Drily tannic, it shows a good core of cherries, violets and herbs. Drink soon.',\n",
       " \"This superpremium effort from Precept Brands is loaded with fruit, and crafted with winemaker Charlie Hoppes' trademark style—lush oak, giving generous barrel flavors of butterscotch and toast. The barrel flavors dominate, complemented by bold black cherry, blackberry and cassis fruit.\",\n",
       " 'Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated, the blend also includes about one third Merlot and a splash of Syrah. Tight and somewhat reductive when first opened, it slowly unwraps into a substantial effort, dense with berry, cherry and cassis concentrate. Some not-quite-integrated green tannins remain, and the buttery finish also wants more bottle age. But a good effort overall.',\n",
       " 'The blend includes 6% Pinot Gris. This is a crisp, well-crafted bottle of wine, with more flesh and fruit than the Pine & Post Chardonnay from Precept Brands. Melon, pear, and orange fruit is accented with a little honey; this is a big step forward for this brand.',\n",
       " 'Definitely a step up from the regular Chardonnay; this is more substantial, bringing in some mineral, citrus rind and spice along with apple and pear flavors.',\n",

       " 'This wine opens sweet, smelling of lemon and grapefruit, and is appropriately creamy in mouthfeel, with a sliver of sweetness on the finish.',\n",
       " 'Floral and fruity, with abundantly ripe peach and melon flavors, this semidry Riesling is juicy and sweet without being cloying. Penetrating fruit flavors ease off on the midpalate on the way to a dainty, sugar-laced finish.',\n",
       " 'Soft and sweet, this Pinot has simple but appealing raspberry, cherry, cola and spice flavors. It would score higher if the texture was more potent.',\n",
       " 'Waxy floral and lemon skin notes are elegantly subdued on this concentrated semidry Riesling. Juicy on the palate with abundant peach preserve flavors, it finishes moderately long with on a slightly drying, tea inflected note.',\n",
       " 'Soft, sweet and fruity, tasting like a granola bar, with roasted almonds, raspberry filling and cinnamon spice.',\n",
       " \"There are solid Cabernet flavors of blackberries and black currants in this dry, tannic wine. It's rough and astringent in the mouth, without much charm, but a rich steak, maybe topped with a gorgonzola sauce, will make it shine.\",\n",
       " \"Whoa... need... water. Michael David's Earthquake is all about impact, no bones about it. And this one won't disappoint people who like their wine like finely aged Scotch, high in alcohol. For them, its bold smoky chocolate, savory bacon on toast notes will be delightful.\",\n",
       " 'Lots of zippy acidity in this Chardonnay. Lots of sweetness, too. Tastes like lemon and pineapple pie filling, with heat from the alcohol.',\n",

       " 'Much of the fruit for this wine came from Alexander Valley and it represents the appellation well, combining the ability to be juicy and approachable with powerful tannins and the potential to age. Cassis, raspberry and black pepper are standout characteristics, and the wine is big, but balanced.',\n",

       " \"This wine's nose begins very steely, with fresh cracked chalk aromas, then allows soft caramel candy, pound cake and white flowers to emerge. The very inviting flavors include apple flesh and skins, fresh cut pineapple and slated nuts, all clinging to a very pithy element that cuts the entire palate.\",\n",
       " \"This complex, flavorful wine walks on the wild side with a bit of funky barnyard in the aromas and flavors. It's dry, moderately tannic, rather light in body, and brings spicy black pepper, grilled beef and ripe plum flavors.\",\n",
       " 'This is a successful straight-ahead Chardonnay, with aromas of buttercream, vanilla and orange cake developing complexity thanks to alkaline, pithy notes. For such a rich nose, it proves quite clean and crisp on the palate, with lemon-lime soda, wet slate and just a touch of buttered apples.',\n",
       " 'Light, tart cherry fruit beckons for further exploration. The ripeness is there, and the wine comes across as clean and elegant in its modest proportions. As it breathes open there is a slight hint of volatility which, for most tasters, will be a plus.',\n",

The palate presents a medium level of density, with flavors of Bing cherry, ollallieberry and dried oregano, thyme and marjoram.',\n",
       " 'Floral, this medium-bodied white is creamy and touched by richer notions of pear, pineapple and vanilla, reflective of its warmer appellation in a warm year. French oak (40% of it new) aged the wine for under a year. With a touch of honeysuckle and nutmeg, the minerality is subtle.',\n",
       " 'A mix of strawberry-rhubarb compote, mocha-chocolate and chalky tannins are featured in this 80% Cabernet with smaller amounts of other Bordeaux varieties blended in. Dense and meaty, a powerful jolt of cassis rears its head on the finish.',\n",

       " \"Deep penetrating sour-cherry and raspberry flavors are balanced against brisk blood-orange acidity in this dry Pinot Noir rosé. Full bodied and slightly silky on the palate, it's a satisfyingly mouthfilling but invigorating wine to enjoy now through the fall months.\",\n",
       " \"This perennially delicious blend brings together 53% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 12% Mourvèdre. It lets each variety speak, offering a structured expression of juicy strawberry, mint and balanced ripeness. Despite its nuances, it's not afraid to be bold.\",\n",
       " \"Blackberry and chocolate flavors intertwine nicely in this soft, round and bright red from a tiny site in the appellation. Lightly spiced with clove and cedar, it strikes a balance between fruit and tension, making it a food-friendly option that won't overpower in the glass.\",\n",

       " \"Intense and loaded with scents and flavors of fully ripe fruit, this parades down the tree fruit and tropical fruit avenues, with peach, apricot, papaya and mango in the lead. It's a delicious bottle, with just enough acidity to keep it bright and lively.\",\n",
       " \"Regrettably, this has no sweetness scale on the back label, but the 11.5% alcohol suggests that it is off-dry, as it certainly tastes. It's a heavy, honey-soaked style, perhaps due to grapes that were affected by botrytis.

       " \"This is a blush wine made primarily from the Spanish variety, Tempranillo. It's fairly dark for a rosé and quite full-bodied in cherry jam, pepper and vanilla flavors, while a splash of Albariño adds needed acidity and the bright taste of citrus.\",\n",

       " \"Verdelho is one of those new varieties imported from old Europe that's providing a badly needed shot in the arm for California, namely, the need for crisply acidic, dry whites. It's a zesty, refreshing wine, with lemon-honey, peach and vanilla flavors.\",\n",
       " 'The high alcohol is a good indication of the ultraripe fruit flavors here. Raisins and cooked cherries dominate, set against a background of tart cherry-pie acids. The concentration is impressive, as is the purity of the fruit flavors.',\n",
       " 'Light and clear in color, this wine veers into cool-climate, restrained territory in its well-defined lines of sage, dried herb and stemmy earth. Dry tannins give an oomph of power beneath traces of dried rose.',\n",

       " \"Rare to find on its own, as it's mainly used in sparkling-wine blends, this Pinot Meunier is earthy in dark truffle and herb, more savory, dry flavors that are wrapped in tightly woven tannins and oak. The muted fruit that's there recalls sweet raspberry.\",\n",
       " 'Dark-berry aromas meet hints of menthol and game on the nose. The medium-bodied palate follows suit on entry, but becomes lighter by the midpalate from a slick of minerality. Pair alongside gamy meats such as grilled venison loin.',\n",
       " 'With 26 months in small oak barrels, aromas of coconut cream, finely ground sawdust and cherry stems ride over condensed black cherry and currant. The medium-weight palate has a plush feel to it, offering a balance of ripe berry fruit and zesty streaks of minerals.',\n",
       " 'This is an unusual commingling of mostly Rhone varieties, a mix of 75% Viognier, 12% Roussanne and 12% Marsanne, with the addition of 3% Sémillon. Honeycomb and Nilla wafer rise from the nose before a medium-bodied swirl of sour lemon, grapefruit and yuzu give it tartness on the finish.',\n",

       " \"The cool vintage was a challenge, which speaks well of the winery's vineyard team. Blended with 5% Petite Sirah, the wine is unusually complex and sumptuous, even by Dry Creek standards. The flavors are rich with wild summer blueberries and blackberries, and savory with pepper and other exotic spices.\",\n",
       " \"The sixteenth edition of Dunham's benchmark Cabernet Sauvignon bears a strong scent of new oak—it's aged in 70% French and 30% American.

It drinks well now, and will develop further in the bottle over the next eight years.\",\n",
       " 'Sourced principally from Klipsun, with smaller amounts from Champoux and Seven Hills, this tight, dark, richly-flavored wine has impeccable credentials. Black fruits, espresso and citrus—notably blood orange—mingle seamlessly, though it takes some hours to open up. The Red Mountain fruit contributes characteristic notes of iron ore and underlying minerality.',\n",
       " \"Coming on the heels of the extraordinary 2009 vintage, this '10 is a worthy followup. It's bone dry, tannic and enormously complex, offering waves of blackberry, currant, cola, new oak and spice flavors. It's so good now, you may not want to cellar it, but try. It will begin to approach its peak after 2017.\",\n",
       " \"The 85% of Cabernet Sauvignon is upfront, with Syrah providing an accent. It's tightly wound, with notes of dusty cherry, sautéed herbs and spices, and tart cranberries supported by chewy, firm tannins that need time in the cellar to come into their own. Best after 2017.\",\n",
       " 'Caldwell managed to wrest plenty of blackberry and cherry fruit into this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, even though the vintage was a tough one.

It should age well though and your window of drinking begins in 2019.',\n",

       " \"This sources grapes from the oldest (1972) blocks at Sagemoor, yielding a deep, rich and intense wine saturated with black cherry, cassis, licorice and barrel flavors. It's perfectly balanced, drinking beautifully, and fit for cellaring over a decade or longer.\",\n",
       " \"This is the first vintage for Upright—100% Klipsun Vineyard and 100% varietal Merlot. Thick and syrupy, it's a full throttle wine, with deep flavors of berry, cherry and cassis.

       " 'Sourced from a vineyard high up in the Mayacamas, on the Sonoma County side, this wine is intense with mountain grown fruit. The palate is full of ripe black currants, mocha and plenty of toasty oak. The tannins, while soft and pliant, are penetrating. All indications are of a wine that wants time in the cellar.

The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it. Now–2021.\",\n",
       " 'A stunning Pirouette—63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 9% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Full and magnificently rich, it is loaded with dense and thrilling fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis. A streak of iron and a hint of citrus keep the wine evolving through a long, beautifully balanced finish. Retasted after being open for 24 hours, the wine was as fresh and thrilling as on the first day.',\n",
       " \"An outstanding wine, the best California Cabernet Jean-Charles Boisset has ever produced from any of his properties. It stands out in any tasting of its peers. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and aged in 60% new oak, it shows satisfying, complex flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cassis, hazelnut-infused chocolate and spices. Hard to exaggerate its power and grace. Wonderful now and for a good six years, but it's difficult to predict its evolution beyond 2018.\",\n",
       " \"A drop-dead gorgeous Pinot Noir that will satisfy everyone from Burgundy fans to diehard Cabernet cultists. Show an elegant complexity and silky texture that define great California Pinot Noir, yet with a powerful impact that emphasizes raspberries, cherries and blueberries. Brilliant acidity and tannins provide the perfect framework on this wine that's drinkable now, and will develop over the next 15–20 years.\",\n",
       " \"A huge Cabernet, in the best sense of the word. It wasn't the easiest vintage, as 2007 was, but meticulous winemaking did the job, resulting in this amazingly rich, impressively ripe wine that's drinkable now and will develop for many years. The fruits veer toward blackberries, cherries and cola, and the tannins are soft and refined. One hundred percent new French oak isn't at all heavy, lending nuances of buttered toast and sweet wood tannins. Will easily age for 15 years.\",\n",
       " \"A triumph, one of the greatest Riverblock bottings in years. This always is a captivating wine, but the '09 is particularly scrumptious. Although it's quite tannic and acidic, it's forward enough in raspberries, cherries and cola to enjoy now. But it's bone dry and as elegant as California Pinot Noir gets. The balance suggests an ability to age for a good 10 years, if not longer.\",\n",
       " \"A sip is all it takes to fall in love with this potent Pinot Noir. Big tannins and crisp acidity make it hard to appreciate now, but there's a gigantic core of cherries and raspberries, with a firm minerality from the soil. Will develop bottle complexity over the years. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2015.\",\n",
       " 'Certainly the finest Grand Ciel Syrah to date, this is a full-flavored, complete wine, loaded with pure fruit flavors of berry and cassis. The details pile on—a whiff of stone, a hint of chocolate, suggestions of spice, all in perfect proportion.',\n",
       " \"A tremendous Chardonnay. As always, the winery's '09 is bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally. You might call it austere at this point, with its tart finish of grapefruit. But a great Hanzell Chardonnay will improve for at least a decade, possible two, and this is a great Hanzell Chardonnay. The score reflects what the wine likely will be approximately eight years down the road.\",\n",
       " 'A blend of three vineyards, all estate, this is a sublime, viscous and somewhat briny wine that exhibits some oak on the nose. With a balance of weight and creaminess, it starts in ginger and nutmeg spiciness on the nose, building on the palate into fresh-cut apple and pear.',\n",
       " \"Ripe, luscious black cherries and berries are framed by whispers of bramble and tannin in this enticingly fruity, forward Syrah. A showcase of fresh, primary fruit, it's juicy and delightfully gulp-worthy. Drink now through 2017.\",\n",

       " \"The aromas of flowers and freshly cut pear, melon and starfruit are bright and fresh. This wine is dry and thick in feel with abundant citrus-rind flavors. There's enjoyment to be had but it gets bogged down in the middle.\",\n",
       " 'Popping with aromas of lychee, rose, geranium and violet this wine is quite perfumed. There are also citrus notes of lime zest and lemon curd. Flavors are perfumed and soapy as well, and it wine coats your mouth. The finish is long with a slightly bitter end.',\n",
       " 'Intense yeasty aromas lean a bit nutty with a suggestion of citrus. Aggressively frothy bubbles give way to cashews and bread dough showing hints of lemon. Grapefruit pith and peanut skin bring a slightly bitter note to the finish.',\n",
       " 'Powerful aromas of lychee, mango and peach give a vibrant feel tropical to this wine. These aromas show the palate and are joined by peach candies and rosewater. With decent acidity, this still feels viscous on the palate and has a medium finish that ends with ginger spice.',\n",
       " 'A bit of charred wood and black pepper in the aroma give way to lush berry and cherry flavors that spread across the palate and cling to the sides of the mouth. This wine is lightly oaky and has an attractive richness that lasts on the finish.',\n",
       " 'Full and ripe, this wine offers thick meaty flavors of pineapple and peach, finishing in sweet vanilla oak.',\n",
       " 'Substantial fruit flavors and a lightly sweet balance give this medium- bodied wine a decent drinkability factor. The mouthfeel is slightly tannic and the finish is brief.',\n",
       " 'A light earthy, toasted aroma and mostly savory rather than outright fruity flavors mark this medium-bodied, dry wine. The texture is smooth and rich enough to complete a good picture.',\n",
       " 'With ripe, generic fruit flavors, a soft texture and slight sweetness, this is a very easygoing, easy-drinking, light-bodied wine.',\n",
       " 'This plummy, dusty red wine is simple and straightforward in its approach to tannin and oak. Offered at a fair price it should please a wide range of palates.',\n",
       " 'This is a neutral, papery white wine, with a flat, rather than lively mouthfeel. The apple flavored fruit is there, along with a touch of licorice, but the freshness seems to have been lost along the way.',\n",
       " \"Roughly equal portions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot go into this tannic blend. It may be a little too far along the aging curve, at least for showing much fruit. It's drying out—displaying a touch of leather—and should be consumed as soon as possible.\",\n",
       " \"The Claret benefits from an additional year of bottle age, integrating the components (60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% each Cab Franc and Malbec). Tart red-berry fruit is accented with light toast from barrel aging. There's a slight hint of burnt rubber that will blow off with decanting.\",\n",
       " \"This is a light simple red, without particular varietal character. It's much like an inexpensive California Merlot—fine for every day drinking, generic and unassuming.\",\n",

       " \"Quady North's Flagship is what the owners consider the best lot of wine of the year. Generously slathered in toasty new oak, this very limited (two barrel) reserve from the estate's Frank's Vineyard is not the blockbuster of the previous vintage, but shows exceptional winemaking skills. Black cherry fruit is wrapped in woody tannins, a yin-yang combination that works by dissonance rather than harmony.\",\n",
       " 'A huge, ripe, opulent wine, rich in orange, butter, peach, honey and spice flavors. Shows great depth and power, yet finishes thoroughly dry and crisp. Should develop bottle complexities over the next six years. Blended with 15% Roussanne.',\n",
       " 'Flamboyantly rich in cherries, raspberries and cranberries that are a bit tart, yet enriched with sweet oak. Firm acidity brings everything to a clean, bright finish. A pretty wine, showing elegance and finesse.',\n",
       " 'Gavin Chanin makes this distinctive, interesting Chardonnay. Shows a ino Sherry-like yeastiness, and is minerally and streamlined. Zesty flavors of limes, kiwis and grapefruits round out the finish.',\n",
       " 'Another Livermore Valley producer to watch, Cuda Ridge has fashioned a varietally textbook Cab Franc here, with an intensely woody, herbal nose. Medium-bodied, with tannins that are integrated and ready to soften, this Cab Franc, barrel-aged for 18 months, is really, really good, and ready to age another 3–5 years.',\n",
       " 'Fruit-driven, with pear and apple, but an interesting streak of licorice running down the spine of the wine. It has depth and good structure, so the now-dominant young fruit will have support as it ages. Worth sitting on for a couple more years.',\n",
       " 'Fragrant with a mix of sweet grass and dusty blossom, this pleasant Sauvignon Blanc makes you wonder why the grape is so rare in Oregon. Here in the Umpqua Valley it finds a sweet spot, fresh and varietal, round and tart, with the added complexity of the flowery aromatics.',\n",
       " 'As soft and smooth as velvet, with superripe flavors of chocolate, blackberry and cherry pie filling, currants, cassis and sweetly toasted oak. A best blend of vineyards available to the winery, this Cab was aged in 100% new French oak. The alcohol level is high, leading to questions of ageability.',\n",
       " \"Lots of tannins and acidity on this dry Grenache, but it's so rich and sweet in cherries, you can drink it now. Somehow manages to be fun and serious at the same time. A real success for this finicky variety in California.\",\n",
       " \"An unusual blend of Viognier and Chardonnay, the wine is brilliantly dry and crisp. It's rich and spicy in citrus, tropical fruit and spice flavors, brightened with bracing acidity. Opulent, yet crisp and refreshing.\",\n",
       " 'Rich and opulent, showing masses of honeydew melon, orange crème, vanilla and spicy flavors. Really seductive, so easy to like. A touch of oak adds just the right note of smoke. Great with roast pork.',\n",
       " 'In a word, wow. What a wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon. It has got to be one of the best buys out there, so rich and smooth in berry, cherry, currant and spice flavors. Only 640 cases were produced, but worth a search. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"The '06 vintage was kind to the winery's basic Sauvignon Blanc, providing a clean, crisp, dry white with flavors of lemon, lime, pineapple, nectarine and honey, and a zingy touch of tart gooseberry. Shows a complexity you don't usually find at this price.\",\n",
       " 'Pronounced minerality and fresh, bright fruit are balanced nicely in this stylish wine. A touch of spice adds dimension. Pair with poultry dishes.',\n",
       " 'This Central Coast vineyard has produced an extraordinarily rich, vibrant Viognier, brimming with tropical fruit, wildflower, honey and vanilla-spice flavors. It benefits from crisp acidity, and finishes clean and off-dry.',\n",
       " \"Here's a likeable Chard, with peach, pear and fig flavors that have a distinctly herbal edge, like dried sage. Turns buttery and vanilla-y on the finish.\",\n",
       " \"With a honeyed edge of sweetness to the pineapple and lime flavors, this wine also has a zesty acidity that makes it finish with mouthwatering cleanness. It's easy to like, a nice late afternoon cocktail sipper, and good with baked ham or pot stickers.\",\n",
       " 'The earthy spice character of this masculine but poised Pinot makes it a unique and stylish pick for red wine lovers. Flavors are balanced, the acids are in check and the finish is delicate but spicy. Overall, a nice wine with class.',\n",
       " 'Layers of round, appealing Chardonnay aromas lead into this nicely balanced offering from New York. Earthy spice and good acidity give the wine both complexity and elegance, and the finish is lengthy. A good wine for solo sips or pairing with poultry and fish.',\n",
       " \"Coming from an extreme coastal vineyard three miles north of Cambria, this cool-climate study offers aromas of blistered cherry tomatoes, Eastern European goulash spices and crushed peppercorns of all colors. It's fresh and lively on the palate, with hints of rose and tart raspberry. At the same time, it's quite vegetal, with green notes that will evolve into more balanced umami flavors from 2017 to 2022.\",\n",
       " 'From a vineyard 1,700 feet above the small town of Corralitos comes this tasty wine that begins with aromas of smoked apple, lemon zest, honeysuckle and sea salt, as well as a struck-match element. The palate shows flavors of fresh apple, chamomile and a dusting of crushed vanilla, all set against a chalky grip.',\n",
       " \"A blend of fruit sources used for the winery's three single-vineyard wines, this bottling saw no new oak and is light golden in color with reserved notes of mineral, almond, pineapple and lees. Full bodied, rich and layered with a creamy feel, it's appealing now but should have a long life ahead.\",\n",
       " \"This blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre, Carignan, Counoise, Grenache and Cinsault immediately appeals with its aromas of plum, candied raspberry and garrigue, with no oak influence anywhere in sight. It's fruit laden, focused and supple, with a feel that dazzles the senses and pure fruit flavors that just won't quit.\",\n",
       " \"Whereas many Syrahs from this vintage from the Rocks District show more fruit than usual, this wine is clearly rooted in the stones. It's aromatically expressive with black olive, crushed flowers, mineral, black pepper and an earthy funk. Flavors are silky soft in feel, with a well-balanced mixture of fruit and savory notes that leads to a lingering finish.\",\n",
       " \"This blend of Les Collines (60%), Lewis (20%) and Portteus (20%) vineyards, which saw 25% new French oak, offers blueberry and huckleberry along with herb and dark chocolate accents. It's supple and soft in feel, deft but with depth to the fruit flavors.\",\n",
       " 'Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal. Its intense energy is a little wound up now, but will blossom with time.',\n",
       " 'The aging program for this Syrah, which comes from a vineyard near the intersection of the Carmel and Salinas valleys, results in a solidly balanced wine. Pepper, boysenberry and game consume the nose, with blackberry fruit, mint, tobacco and a greenish bitterness keeping the palate interesting.',\n",
       " 'This is an extremely rare beast—a single-vineyard, single-varietal (Pinot Noir), single-vintage sparkling wine. Aged sur lie for 42 months, it draws you into the glass with notes of smoke, raspberry, mineral and nutty spices. The flavors are light and lively with tart, racy acidity and a long, lingering finish.',\n",
       " \"A deep, dark color, unusually ripe and exotic aromas, and intense flavors recalling boysenberry syrup make this a monster Zin. It's not very tannic or astringent, but the body is so rich and the alcohol relatively high that it oozes power and concentration. This will be great after a meal with cheese or chocolate.\",\n",
       " 'This barrel-fermented wine has opulent aromas of nougat, butterscotch and pear tart. Equally interesting flavors stress the spice and pastry notes rather than straightforward fruitiness. It is attractively rich in mouth feel, dry, full-bodied and grand in style.',\n",
       " 'This is a straightforward quaffer. Aromas of herbs, jasmine and stone fruit lead to sugary-sweet fruit flavors.',\n",
       " \"This wine is a field blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache from Bishop's vineyard. Aromas of herbs, berry, cumin and wet copper penny are followed by smooth-feeling dark berry flavors with a tart, mesquite-filled finish.\",\n",
       " 'Apple and pear notes have a slightly savory tone in this brisk, lemony dry Riesling. Throughout a tasting of two samples, there are lingering tones of rubber and struck matches that blow off gradually with aeration.',\n",
       " 'This juicy red wine offers thick layers of black pepper and blueberry around sturdy oak. However, its opulent beginnings start to thin on the midpalate, veering into sour flavors and a touch of heat.',\n",
       " \"Sweet green apple, lemon and lime notes meld in this off-dry Riesling, somewhat evocative of green Jolly Rancher's candy. Whiffs of smoke and nuts add a savory dimension to this brisk, easy drinking wine. Drink now.\",\n",
       " 'All Merlot, this pale-pink wine offers aromas of herbs, grass and cherry. Though the label suggests otherwise, it drinks off dry, with pit-fruit flavors.',\n",
       " 'A very deep red color catches the attention. Next, strong, wild aromas like smoke and black rubber lead to a rather fruity but still firm and tannic texture. The flavors are more like blackberries and blueberries, but the overall effect is slightly viscous.',\n",
       " 'Dark, dry and puckering with a stewed plum aroma and flavor, this wine offers a depth of tannin and herbal notes. A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 8% Merlot, it spent 20 months in French oak.',\n",
       " \"This Southern Rhône-style blend is roughly half Mourvèdre, 31% Grenache and 17% Cinsault. It's a delicious match-up, with the Mourvèdre underscoring the minerality, and providing grip and texture around the racy red berry flavors of the other two grapes. The wine has a spine of steel, suggesting it will age through 20206–2022.\",\n",
       " \"This is a über aromatic wine with a long list of notes that include orange marmalade, peach, citrus, and drizzled honey. Harvested at 42 brix and retaining a whopping 240 g/L residual sugar, it's supremely rich and sweet with a lingering finish.\",\n",
       " \"The vineyard is famous for producing ripe, luscious Pinots stuffed with massive fruit. Many wineries have dipped into it over the years. Krutz's rendition is dry, balanced and full-bodied, with relatively high alcohol framing raspberry, cherry, cola, red plum, exotic spice and sandalwood flavors. It should age well through 2020–2022.\",\n",
       " \"The vineyard is near if not entirely within the Arroyo Grande Valley appellation, and it shows that region's tannins, acidity and ripe, long hangtime flavors. The balanced 2012 vintage has given it tremendously ripe cherry, raspberry, red currant and cola flavors, yet the wine retains an exciting sense of control and balance. Give it until 2018–2019 in the cellar to gain traction.\",\n",
       " \"It's risky to suggest aging a California Chardonnay, but you'd do well to stash this away until sometime in 2015. Right now, the wine is all about brisk acidity, oak and fresh, ripe tropical fruit, orange and pear flavors. All those parts need time to come together.\",\n",

       " \"A beautiful wine to pair with desserts based on white fruits or simple but delicious vanilla sponge cake. Made from late-harvested Chardonnay, it's very sweet in apricots, lemons, vanilla and buttered toast, with a brisk edge of acidity for balance.\",\n",
       " \"Since planting in 1997, Bucher Vineyard has been a renowned source of Pinot Noir for exceptional local wineries. Now the Bucher family is making their own wine, with good results.

Begin to enjoy it around 2018.\",\n",
       " 'This is pure Mourvèdre from three excellent Red Mountain sites: Heart of the Hill, Ciel du Cheval and Grand Rêve vineyards. Tart, stony raspberry fruit carries a hint of cured meat and straw. The wine displays excellent length and a delicious purity.',\n",

It's a complete wine, with a full array of superbly rich berry fruits, a hint of chocolate and fine-grained tannins. Delicious right out of the bottle, but it could be cellared for at least another five years.\",\n",
       " 'This hugely ripe Chardonnay is just a little too big for absolute balance. Any more powerful, and it would be over the line. As it is, it flirts with it, with gobs of jammy apricots, yellow pears, citrine and Meyer lemondrop, as well as barrel influences ranging from creamy lees to buttered toast, roasted hazelnuts and smoky honey. The alcohol is over 15%.',\n",
       " 'This is a high acid style of Chardonnay, reflective of a vintage that was one of the coolest in a decade or more. Crisp and detailed, this offers a classy mix of citrus and apple, wet stone and light baking spices. Hints of nutmeg and cinnamon adorn the fruit, which lingers gently through a citrusy finish.',\n",
       " 'Complex mixed stone fruits dappled with sweet cinnamon spice lead into a fairly lush midpalate. The dominant flavor is fresh cut pear, and the creamy texture spreads the flavors broadly through the mouth. A lovely wine to match with halibut or swordfish.',\n",
       " \"Hendry has a good track record with Cabernet, and although this isn't their best effort, it's an interesting, moderately ageworthy wine. It's pretty tough in tannins right now, but the astringency frames ripe blackberry and cassis flavors that linger in the finish. Needs time. Best 2008–2010.\",\n",
       " \"For such a large production Chard, this one gives a lot of concentrated varietal purity. It's dry and crisp, brimming with ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie, pear, date and smoky vanilla flavors that finish with real sophistication and class.\",\n",
       " 'A nice interpretation of Grenache Blanc. Blended with a drop of Viognier, it shows notes of orange and peach jam, honey, vanilla and toasty oak. The alcohol level is high. Drink up.',\n",
       " 'There is a creamy, leesy mouthfeel to this estate-grown Riesling, whose residual sugar is masked with acidity. Tart apple and pear fruit flavors finish with lighter notes of candied orange and citrus.',\n",
       " 'Good and dry, with tough tannins that make it hard to drink now. With blackberry, currant, molasses and dark chocolate flavors, it seems like an ager, but may not have the concentration for the long haul. Try again in 2–3 years.',\n",
       " \"This is a rare beast from Washington—single vineyard Tempranillo aged in neutral oak coming in at less than 13% alcohol. It's soft and light with notes of red fruit and refreshing acidity that drops off on the back half.\",\n",
       " \"Easy to drink this blend of all five classic Bordeaux varieties, with Merlot predominating. It's all about cherries, blackberries, plum jam, currants and chocolate. Not particularly subtle or ageworthy, but very pretty.\",\n",
       " \"This is a tough, chewy Merlot, a bit of a stylistic departure for Walla Walla Vintners. Perhaps it's the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, or perhaps just the result of the challenging 2010 vintage in the Walla Walla Valley. But the greenish tannins bring a lot of herbal flavors to the forefront, and tend to bury the fruit.\",\n",
       " \"Mondavi's done it again, produced another very nice Cabernet at an everyday price. It shows classy elegance, with blackberry, currant and mocha notes.\",\n",
       " \"With a bit of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec, this Cab is marked by hard tannins and blackberry and cherry jam, black currant and oak flavors. The finish is gripping, however, it's pretty tart, and you have to wonder if that sharpness will ever age out. Decant and drink up.\",\n",
       " 'Aged in 68% new French oak, the barrel notes take center stage here with aromas of toast and spice. The palate is creamy and full with a viscous feel, tapering in concentration toward the finish.',\n",
       " \"It's not easy to get 16.5% alcohol from a vintage as cool as 2010 in Washington. The wine has a grain and grass bouquet, wild and brambly fruit, and plenty of Asian spices. Interesting, though not especially typical for the grape variety\",\n",
       " 'Not the richest Chardonnay ever, but it has complex notes of citrus, apple, nectarine and tropical fruits, with kisses of vanilla and cream. Acidity gives it elegant brightness.',\n",
       " 'This is an enormously rich Cabernet. It explodes in milk chocolate, black cherry, spicy plum and sweet, toasty oak flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Delicious, if a bit one-dimensional. Drink now.',\n",
       " 'Made in a richer, riper style, this Zin brims with flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants and brown sugar, like a Christmas fruitcake. The alcohol is quite high. Drink soon.',\n",
       " \"This is a fine, all-purpose red blend, mostly Cabernet, with time in one-third new French and American oak. Heavily charred, smoky and earthy, it's got a fair amount of dark cassis fruit to carry all the barrel toast and finishes with some notes of bark and stem.\",\n",
       " \"Lots of early-drinking charm in this Pinot Noir. It's light and silky, with a modest alcohol level that makes it easy to drink. The raspberry, cherry, cola and oak flavors are delicious.\",\n",

       " 'Though this is pure Cabernet from an excellent Walla Walla vineyard, the flavors seem rather harsh and quite astringent. The dark fruit is cloaked in bitter, chalky tannins that require some rich food to cut through.',\n",
       " \"This Chard's oak accents pineapple and lemon fruit flavors. It's dry yet honeyed, that paradox of Chardonnay, with a good burst of citrusy acids for brightness.\",\n",
       " \"Rich and dense, this has blackberry and black cherry jam, mocha and spice flavors. It contains 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, which lends the wine weight and body. While it's technically dry, there's a sweetness that comes from the ripeness of fruit and the caramel flavor from the oak, which gives it a sugary, bacony taste. Delicious now and for a few years.\",\n",
       " \"Rich, exotic notes of honey-glazed papaya and warm pear are accented by touches of white flower, graham cracker and lemon custard. The palate feels round and weighty, with flavors that aren't as effusive as one might expect. Acids provide enough spine to keep the palate from drooping, with hints of clove and lemongrass adding interest. A blend of 55% Chardonnay, 45% Viognier.\",\n",
       " 'This has acidity and tannins that are rich and complex. The raspberry, cola and licorice flavors have a nice coating of smoky oak.',\n",

       " \"Sporting a much-improved label design, the 2009 Natasha brings pungent, assertive scents of tomato leaf, pepper and moist earth. Sharp and focused, the fruit is there, though it's the leaf and earth components that stand out. For its earthy style, it's a well-made and complex offering.\",\n",
       " \"At just 12.6% alcohol, this might seem underripe for warm climate varieties, but it tastes perfectly full and nicely balanced. It's tart and lemony, to be sure, and in fact makes a fine accompaniment to fresh-shucked oysters.\",\n",
       " \"This is the most complete of the four Prince Hill clonal selection bottlings. It has flavors of cherry, Dr. Pepper, cherry candy and a hint of incense. It's a pleasant, easy-drinking wine best consumed while still young.\",\n",
       " \"This best-of-barrels Chardonnay is oaky, offering waves of butterscotch and buttered toast that dominate the tart underlying flavors of pineapple and lime. It's certainly rich and well-structured, but quite oaky.\",\n",
       " \"Soft, sweet and appealing, this has raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with an oak-influenced note of buttered toast. It's an easy, gentle wine, with some real depth and complexity.\",\n",
       " 'This smells deep and bass-like, with resonating notes of honeyed white currant, spiced breakfast toast and apricot preserves, accented with touches of caramel and toasted nut. It feels round, rich and opulent, with a nice lift of acids that give the wine some spring.',\n",
       " 'An exotic, spicy Pinot Noir, this is medium-bodied and crisp, with complex cranberry, raspberry, red licorice and smoky sandalwood flavors. Drink this dry, silky effort now.',\n",
       " 'A blend of Grenache, Syrah, Cinsault and Counoise, this is bone dry and brisk in acidity, with complex flavors of mineral, herb, sour cherry candy, red currant and white pepper. Although production was only 2,000 cases, this wine is worth the search.',\n",
       " 'This is serviceable but rather bland, with a dusting of cinnamon spice and simple, tart fruit.',\n",
       " 'Lemon curd and artificial butter show on the nose and palate, with underripe peach adding verve to a creamy body.',\n",
       " 'This full-throttle, oaky Chardonnay features an intriguingly curious mix of corn nuts, diesel and marijuana on the nose. The corresponding layers of flavor are straightforward and simple.',\n",
       " 'Despite its single-vineyard designation, this watery effort could be from anywhere. Thin, dilute, barely ripe strawberry fruit vanishes quickly once in the mouth, and there is little trace of any barrel flavors from aging in 20% new French oak.',\n",
       " 'Underripe fruit seems more sour than anything. Some bitter, stemmy flavors creep into the finish.',\n",
       " 'This is soft and easy in texture, light in flavors and slightly sweet. Light to medium bodied, it has very little tannin or astringency, is low in acidity and quiet on the finish.',\n",
       " \"Amid the blackberry and asphalt tones, this has a funky rubber twist on the nose. The bottling is a side label of Avelina, founded by former Oreana Winery owner Christian Garvin. It's tart and sour on the palate, with dried raspberries and a bit more funk.\",\n",
       " \"Made from Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel, this is one of Rock Wall's drier, lower-alcohol wines. It's high in acidity, with a silky mouthfeel. A little rustic, it shows cherry skin, tobacco and white pepper flavors.\",\n",

       " \"It's a midnight-black wine, full-bodied and tannic, with immense black currant, grilled meat and black pepper flavors that finish bone dry. Already throwing some sediment, it will live for two decades, without gaining in complexity. Drink now–2025.\",\n",
       " \"Coming from the cool 2010 vintage, this 100% varietal wine doesn't quite seem to have fully ripened but still offers plenty of enjoyment with its savory notes of leafy herbs, olive and cherry. It's elegant in its styling with a fresh feel and a cinnamon-speckled finish.\",\n",
       " \"Sourced from a single vineyard, this spent 17 months in French oak, 38% new. It's light and spicy, with pleasant fruit flavors of apple and pear.\",\n",

       " \"Here's a powerful Cabernet Sauvignon, ripe and opulent, offering summer blackberry, sour cherry candy, currant, dried herb and rose petal aromas and flavors. The addition of 21% Merlot brings a candied softness, but it's still pretty tannic, and wants 4–5 years in the cellar.\",\n",
       " \"This brilliant Sauvignon Blanc should be scooped up by sommeliers. It's exceptionally dry and tart in citrusy acids, with a mineral scour that's perfect for shellfish or savory appetizers. The flavors are of lemons, limes, gooseberries and white pepper. Beautiful and compelling.\",\n",
       " \"From a cool part of the valley, this wine is marked by fresh acids that give it a grapey jamminess. It's very rich in black cherries, black raspberries and toast, and very dry. Feels sharp and angular now. Give it through 2010 to calm down.\",\n",
       " \"A beautiful Gewürz that could get more people to drink this Alsatian variety. It's dry and crisp, with rich flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, honeysuckle flowers, lychee nuts, vanilla and Asian spices.\",\n",

       " 'A very fine Cabernet, dry and firm, but it needs a little time in the cellar. Astringent now, it has a deep core of black currants and cedar, with the polished tannins that Napa so easily crafts. Try between 2010–2012.',\n",
       " 'Much improved, with different vineyard sources than in 2004, this strong, varietal Cabernet mixes cassis, black cherry, light herb and hints of moist earth. Aging for 18 months in new French oak brings in coffee and chocolate, balanced and subtly displayed. Nice details of leaf and leather run richly into the tannins.',\n",
       " 'A good Cab, dry and balanced, whose tannins are richly impressive and sweet. Shows a good tension between the oak and the ripe black currants. Easy to like, and should develop for a few years.',\n",
       " 'Elegantly structured, with firm tannins, a silky texture and a fine balance of fruit, acidity and oak. Shows cherry, red currant, cola and sandalwood flavors that are delicious, but those tannins close in on the finish, making the wine hard. Try after 2011.',\n",
       " \"Tangy berry/black cherry fruit is backed with lots of acid and hints of earthy funk. It's not vegetal but it is definitely herbal, a complex and flavorful reserve that falls right between Balboa's regular Syrah and the Sayulita.\",\n",

       " \"Could almost be Zinfandel, it's so spicy and briary, with wild berry, red currant and tobacco flavors. But it's lighter in body, with the silky texture of Pinot Noir, and drier than any Zin could be. A lovely, complex and food-friendly wine.\",\n",
       " \"A nicely crafted debut from a new Walla Walla boutique. The blend—two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one third Syrah—is becoming a classic in Walla Walla.

       " 'This is tropical, boisterous rendition of the grape, with heavy tuberose, white lily, peach and apple-blossom aromas. The palate combines honeysuckle, ripe apple flesh and pineapple-guava flavors.',\n",
       " 'Warm aromas of red cherries, star anise and cinnamon greet the nose with inviting brown spice scents on this entry-level bottling. Cinnamon, cranberry and black plum show on the palate, along with pencil-lead minerality and a tart plum-skin finish.',\n",
       " 'The toast, freshly ground coffee, dark chocolate and cherry aromas pop. Plum and chocolate flavors are smooth in feel and linger on the finish.',\n",
       " 'Shrouds of leafy herbs and savory stems lend a fresh tone to this brisk yet fruity, concentrated Cab. Crisp blackberry and currant flavors shine bright and pert on the palate, framed squarely by lingering strikes of tannin and acidity.',\n",
       " \"Made from eight vineyards located throughout this sprawling appellation, this wine showcases the art of the blend, and is an extraordinary achievement for its sheer opulence. Offers wave after wave of Pinot flavor, with superb tannins and mouthwatering acidity. The fact that this is Merry Edwards's least expensive Pinot Noir is amazing and makes it a special buy. Production was 2,370 cases.\",\n",
       " 'A lovely Pinot, dry, crisp and silky, with ripe raspberry, strawberry and cherry fruit flavors, grounded by notes of grilled mushrooms, exotic spices and forest undergrowth. Sweetly delicious now, it should blossom over the next six years.',\n",
       " \"You know you're dealing with a great Pinot Noir when it's this delicious right out of the bottle, yet will age. This wine is enormously rich and sweet in cherries, blackberries, blueberries and cola, a wine that almost everyone will find delicious. Yet with thick tannins and brisk acidity, it has the protective structure to evolve over at least six years, and possibly longer.\",\n",
       " 'Just wonderful, showing the great richness and complexity of a top Santa Rita Pinot Noir. Partial whole-cluster fermentation gives the wine a spicy earthiness and full-bodied tannins, yet the underlying red berry and cherry fruit shines through. Showing well now and over the next six years.',\n",
       " \"One sip is all it takes to know this is a terrific Pinot Noir. It's dry, silky and complex, and not only that, it will develop bottle nuance over the next six years. Rich and flamboyant in cherry pie filling, persimmon and mushu-plum sauce flavors, yet layered with earthy, foresty notes of mushrooms, soy sauce and balsam. You can drink it now, but give it an hour or two of decanting.\",\n",
       " \"While the texture of this Pinot is silky and light, it's dramatic in flavor. The cherries, plums, pomegranates and persimmons are packed together into a dense core of taste, all spiced up with cinnamon, cloves and anise. Feels dramatic and complex, but young and fresh in acids and tannins. Give it 5–6 years.\",\n",
       " 'The vineyard is in the coolest part of the Green Valley of the Russian River Valley. The wine, which is totally dry, is marked by brilliant acidity and long hangtime flavors of oranges, Meyer lemons and kiwi fruit, enriched by barrel fermentation and aging.',\n",
       " \"A terrific Pinot Noir, from a winery compiling a serious track record. Grown on the Napa side of Carneros, the wine shows classic Primo's Hill character, with the blackberry pie, cola, mushu plum and sandalwood flavors accented by a little more acidity than usual. Defined by elegance and complexity, it's an ager, although it's beautiful now right out of the bottle. Should easily develop through 2015.\",\n",
       " \"This is a big, mouthfilling Cabernet, rich and voluptuous in fruit. Although it's a bit hot in alcohol, you hardly notice it, with the explosion of blackberries, raisins and chocolate-covered cherries, made even richer by smoky-sweet oak. Delicious now and through 2014.\",\n",
       " 'A bit disjointed, with acidity sticking out, and the fruit tending toward jammy blackberries, raspberries and nectarines, leading to sharpness in the finish. Could mellow and improve in a couple years.',\n",

       " \"Andy Beckstoffer is starting to release wines from his Red Hills vineyards, and this release is promising, especially at this price. It's fruity and tasty in blackberries and cherries, while oak adds rich notes of caramel and vanilla. Rich and savory, this Cab delivers lots to like.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a lusty, rugged Zinfandel marked by strong, superripe flavors. The blackberries and plums veer into currants and raisins, and finish spicy and dry, while enormously high alcohol gives the impression of heat. But that's Zinfandel for you. Needs a grilled flank steak to play against.\",\n",
       " \"Made in a lighter style, this silky Pinot Noir has crisp acidity accentuating flavors of cherries, red licorice and cola. It's an elegant wine for drinking now.\",\n",

       " \"Rich in fruit and oak, but balanced with crisp acidity. It's strongly flavored, brimming with pineapple jam, white peach, apricot, buttered toast and vanilla. Gets the Chardonnay job done with some elegance.\",\n",

       " \"There is loads of freshly crushed black pepper in this dry, robust Zin. It's almost enough to make you sneeze. You'll also find good blackberry fruit and heady alcohol. Drink up.\",\n",
       " 'Light to the point of being a bit dilute, this Viognier has a cotton-candy character, like spun sugar around rhubarb. The tart, not quite fully ripe fruit brings it to a quick, acidic finish.',\n",
       " \"Aged mostly in stainless steel with a touch of new French oak (10%), this has notes of toast and char along with freshly cut mango. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied, drinking just a hair off dry with a bitter note on the finish.\",\n",
       " \"This is a rustic but likeable wine. It's dry, tannic and full-bodied, with good varietal flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and sweet, smoky oak. Drink soon.\",\n",
       " 'This meaty, oaky Sauvignon Blanc, with a trace of Semillon, is slightly bitter with grassy and lemony aromas and flavors coming to the fore.',\n",
       " \"A common, country-style wine, rich in cherries, cola and spices, with lusty tannins. It's lush and simple, but will rise to the occasion with a cheeseburger. The blend is Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Graciano.\",\n",
       " 'Very ripe and extracted, just oozing the flavors of melted blackberry jam, black raspberry purée and milk chocolate. A bit sweet, but saved by firm tannins.',\n",
       " \"The fruit scents explode from the glass, showing raspberries, blueberries, cherries and plums in profusion. There is more stuffing, especially apparent in the nose and also in the mouth, than in the winery's varietal blends. The back end of the wine suggests bread and chocolate, light hints of toasted almond and cinnamon spice.\",\n",
       " \"Compared to Highlands' regular Cab, this is a great example of sometimes, more is less. The '06 Reserve is a gigantic wine, both in ripely extracted currants and in the taste of new, smoky oak. But it's very size makes it ponderous. The question is one of ageability. It could well be a sleeper. Try beyond 2010.\",\n",
       " 'This big, buttery Chardonnay will especially appeal to those who like California-style flavors; here enhanced with the firm acids characteristic of Washington State. There is a generous streak of vanilla cream, a soft and very buttery mouthfeel, yet the fruit has enough precision and focus that the wine does not lose definition. Delicious now, this is a wine to drink over the next three or four years.',\n",
       " \"Negociant Hughes continues to produce compelling wines at everyday prices. This Syrah, from one of Napa Valley's best mountain regions, is dry and thick in refined tannins. But it's so rich in black currants, black cherries, chocolate, pepper and sweet, smoky oak that it's delicious now.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a strongly flavored Merlot, made with ultraripe fruit. If it didn't have a good structure, the blackberry, currant, mocha and anise flavors alone would make it a fruit bomb. Fortunately, fine acidity and gorgeously thick tannins give it structure and backbone. Best for a year or two.\",\n",
       " 'Ripe, fruity and delicious. Flatters with deep, long flavors of blackberries, black currants, cassis and cedar, with a lush, tannic mouthfeel and long finish. Nice now, and should develop beyond 2012.',\n",
       " 'Lemon and herb aromas suggest a lean, crisp wine but the flavors are fairly ripe and the texture is rich and soft. Appley, floral and not at all tart, this is pleasant to sip.',\n",
       " \"Light aromas of passion fruit and grapefruit are followed by tropical flavors that linger. It's an easy drinking quaffer.\",\n",
       " \"Vivid plum and prune aromas and flavors define this generous and rather soft-textured wine. The fruit component is so rich it's jammy, and the tannins are very mild. The overall effect is grapy, almost sweet.\",\n",
       " 'This airy confection has aromas of lemon and vanilla, then almost sweet flavors of butterscotch and lemon cream on a fairly soft texture. It is light to medium bodied.',\n",
       " \"Hints of dusty mineral, nut and spice lend a savory tone to apple and pear in this cutting, crisp Riesling. It's honed and steely on the palate, finishing on a reverberating and bitter lime-zest note.\",\n",
       " 'Lighter in color and body than many counterparts, this wine presents a sour blackberry and woody herb nose. Black olives, elderberries, cedar and black pepper beef flavors show on the gravelly palate.',\n",

       " 'Low in oak and high in acidity, this wine skews tart and high-strung in terms of citrus and wet stone-like notions, offering a bouquet of lemon chiffon. A nice entry and finish surround a less-intriguing middle.',\n",
       " \"This doesn't taste true to the grape variety, but it's a good white wine with orange peel, jasmine and tangerine aromas, fairly quiet fruit flavors and then a floral, citrus finish. Light to medium bodied, it has an appetizing texture.\",\n",
       " 'Light aromas of herbs, woodspice, tire rubber and red fruit lead to jammy raspberry and spice flavors that provide easy drinking pleasure.',\n",
       " 'Buoyantly aromatic, this blossomy Traminette sparkling wine stands out in a line up of traditional Champagne-style sparklers. Heady rose and gardenia tones feel perfumey on the palate, but brisk acidity and soft, pillowy foam are pleasant.',\n",
       " 'A soft-textured, rather light-bodied and fruit-forward offering, this smells and tastes like pear, apple and grape juices with a touch of sweetness and low acidity.',\n",
       " 'A rich texture and rather ripe fruit flavors make this softer and broader in taste than many of its peers. Flavors like Fuji apple and Bartlett pear are appealing, and the mouthfeel is smooth and easy rather than crisp.',\n",
       " 'Fresh peach and light floral aromas lead to ripe, grapey flavors and a soft, soothing texture in this medium-bodied wine. It is smooth and low in acid, with a charming flowery element that helps it stand out.',\n",
       " 'Made by an Oregon winery from Carneros region grapes, this wine tastes mellow and mature. It has a relatively light color with an auburn rim, aromas that are savory and meaty, flavors like rhubarb and beef, a fairly crisp balance and smooth texture.',\n",
       " 'Herb, currant, vanilla and tire-rubber aromas are at the fore. The blackberry flavors drink off dry, sweetening toward the finish.',\n",
       " 'Fresh in zingy, ripe blackberry flavor, this well-made Zin has firm tannins and a dollop of peppery spice on the finish.',\n",
       " 'Enticing and idiosyncratic on the nose, this Merlot offers notes of rose petal, smoke, blood orange and caraway seed. The palate is medium bodied and the 13% alcohol gives it a sense of finesse. Fine but firm tannins frame the cherry fruit, and it finishes with hints of maduro and rose.',\n",
       " \"There's lots of rich Chardonnay character in this affordable wine. It's rich with vanilla, buttered toast, honey, orange and pineapple-jam flavors, with brisk acidity providing balance. Great price for a Chard this good.\",\n",
       " \"This Pinot starts out tight, but after some time in the glass opens up to reveal black raspberry, mushroom, cola and exotic spice notes. It's dry, yet silky, in the mouth. A pretty wine, and for the price, a comparative bargain.\",\n",
       " \"Impressive for its power, a wine of considerable interest and complexity. It's rich in black cherries, red currants, cola, bacon and spice flavors, but the texture really stands up, a combination of firm tannins and brilliant acidity. Oak provides complicating notes of sweet toast. Drink soon.\",\n",
       " 'Perfumed in cinnamon-flowery aromatics, this well-valued Zin is softly spiced, lush and smooth, drinkable with black cherry flavor and plenty of personality.',\n",
       " \"This is the ideal anti-Chardonnay white wine. There's no oak at all to interfere with the lemon, lime and mineral flavors, and the acidity is brisk and mouthwatering. A dry, crisply brilliant wine to drink now with everything from sushi to tuna tartare.\",\n",
       " \"Intensely concentrated in black currants, cassis liqueur and oak aromas and flavors, this Cabernet is so strong, it's practically undrinkable now. It's not just the potent tannins and bright acidity, it's the raw, jammy quality of the fruit. All these elements could begin to come together after 2017.\",\n",
       " \"Spicy red currant fruit comes up quickly, backed with the grape's signature accents of stem and earth. There's a residual flavor of slightly bitter tomato leaf.\",\n",
       " \"This is the winery's Left-Bank-Bordeaux-style blend, three quarters Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a pleasing mix of red and black fruits, licorice, toast and smoke, and spent two and a half years in French oak, 60% new. The wine is quite tasty and drinking well, though the blend lacks focus.\",\n",
       " \"Don't let the label mislead you; this is not a dessert wine. It's off-dry, with a pretty suite of lemon, orange and citrus peel flavors. A whiff of tea runs through the aromas, and a bit of lemon oil in the finish.\",\n",
       " 'The top cuvée from Mercer Estates, this reserve is a Bordeaux-style blend based upon 64% Merlot, the rest a mix of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A firm entry introduces a solid mid-palate with a mix of black fruits, coffee and toast. The finish is clean and gentle, with moderate persistence.',\n",
       " 'This young, stainless steel-fermented Chardonnay has a beery hoppiness to the aromas, leading into a tart, juicy and crisp palate of lime and grapefruit. The acids taste of wet stone, and that vivid minerality brings dimension and lift to the finish.',\n",
       " 'This wine is abundant with aromas of cherry Coke, sarsaparilla and baking spice. The palate is delicate yet is given some weight from seven months in neutral French and American oak. This wine gains a soft texture from Tannat skins added during fermentation.',\n",

       " 'This late release sourced from several vineyards dating back to the 1970s and 1980s is thin on the palate, with tart plum, herb, orange peel and of pineapple hints. Low alcohol reflects the cool vintage.',\n",
       " \"Made in the style of a southern Rhône blend (half Viognier and one quarter each Marsanne and Roussanne), this is lightly lemony, with a bit more fat in the middle. None of the three grapes overpowers the others, but the flavors feel a bit generic. Though fermented in stainless steel, it's gold in color and shows some hints of toast.\",\n",
       " \"Exceptionally light, this acid-driven wine is all flowers and green apple, with just the slightest reach out to honeycomb-like texture and weight. It'll do well at the table in its unfussy approach and crispness.\",\n",

       " \"Rich and substantial, this is potent in blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors. High alcohol gives it a hot mouthfeel. It's not really representative of the Arrowood name of old.\",\n",

       " \"The Dion is a new entry in the long list of Erath single-vineyard wines. It doesn't show much in this difficult vintage. Short and intensely herbal, it has strong scents and flavors of tomato leaf, which override any hint of ripe fruit flavor.\",\n",
       " \"It's difficult to understand what this is trying to be. Pinot Gris can show some light blush color, but this wine is almost pink. The result is tannic and tart, with a rhubarb-like flavor.\",\n",

       " 'Cola, dark red fruit, black pepper and oak greet the nose on this blend of 77% Grenache, 19% Syrah and 4% Mourvèdre. The palate is quite structured with firm tannins that could use some mellowing, with flavors of roasted pork, blackberry and prevalent cedar.',\n",
       " \"This wine is a blend of Upland Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (50%), Double Canyon Petit Verdot (38%) and McKinley Springs Malbec.

Those looking for big fruit, look elsewhere.\",\n",

Aromas recall honey, honeysuckle, tart apple and pineapple, and the flavors are like orange zest—tart, crisp and slightly bitter in a good way.

Lighter in body than expected upon the sip, the palate shows cola, bright cranberry juice and a sandalwood spice that makes it very easy to drink.',\n",
       " \"Sunny, peachy sweetness abounds in this light-footed Riesling. Off dry in style, it's breathlessly fresh and fruity, yet intensified by shimmering lime and mineral tones. Drink now for its youthful effervescence.\",\n",
       " 'Aromas of cocoa, spice, vanilla and dark fruit lead, with the oak (20% new French and American) playing a significant role. The blue-fruit flavors are plump in feel, narrowing toward the finish.',\n",
       " 'A dense thicket of dark chocolate is prominent in this wine, alongside black raspberry and blackberry. Dried herb and pencil shavings also make their way through midpalate, atop a soft, approachable texture and full body.',\n",
       " 'A tight nose of boysenberry and pepper shows on this wine from a boutique, artistically labeled SoCal wine project by Ian Sergy and Zach Jarosz. The palate is light and texturally intriguing, with flavors of squeezed berries and crushed oregano, showing bright energy on the sip.',\n",
       " 'Purple fruit aromas of blueberry, blackberry and boysenberry are given complexity with Indian spice, hot asphalt and beef char on the nose of this blend of 88% Syrah and 12% Grenache. The palate is full of crushed herbs, from oregano to thyme to marjoram, with just a tiny shred of cranberry fruit and lots of pine sap and even bell pepper.',\n",
       " 'Sunflower-gold in color, this heady, hedonistic Chardonnay brims with aromas of toasted brioche, lemon and herb. Bright and completely balanced, it invites sip after sip until there simply is no more. Concentrated and complex it finishes dry, lingering in beautiful layers on the tongue.',\n",
       " \"Sourced from the best barrels made at the winery in 2013, this off-dry reserve checks in with roughly 30 g/L residual sugar, and plenty of acidity to more than balance it out. It's sweet, tart and sappy, with concentrated, juicy flavors of Meyer lemon, grapefruit and tangerine. It feels full-bodied and roundly fruity, then continues to extend itself with concentrated details of mineral and acid. A wine of exceptional power and length.\",\n",
       " \"Fresh in mouthwatering minerality, this is positively bright, balanced and layered in lingering notes of lemon curd, green apple and just-picked vanilla bean. It is a gloriously delicate wine that's named for one of Marimar's beloved Springer Spaniels, made from one block planted to a selection of the See clone.\",\n",
       " 'Fruit comes from three places for this wine, Bennett Valley, Alexander Valley and Knights Valley, exhibiting some good blending skill in the cellar. Red currant, clove, cedar and pencil all appear around a full-bodied, leathery texture and dots of black pepper and sage.',\n",
       " 'The producer travels to Stagecoach Vineyard on Atlas Peak to source 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 38% Syrah and 7% Malbec, making for a softly layered wine with plenty of structure. Crisp red currant and plum dance around savory specks of cedar and toasty oak.',\n",
       " 'Yellow grapefruit pith, white Asian pear flesh, cherimoya and crisp stonefruit elements show on the nose of this bottling, which also offers the typical touch of petrol. The palate is very pithy and high-toned, showing lemon rind, sour orange and sour apple on the finish.',\n",
       " 'Dried blueberry fruit, asphalt, black plums and chocolate sauce aromas show on the nose of this appellation blend by the Rhône specialist. Tart black fruit, tar, fudge and fresh purple flowers show on the palate, an always reliable intro to the popular Central Coast grape.',\n",
       " \"Nearly equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this dusty red also makes use of 26% Syrah, 3% Cabernet Sauvignon and 3% unidentified as other. A straightforward wine, it's juicy in blackberry and chalky chocolate.\",\n",
       " 'A very interesting wine, this is reserved but complex, not overtly fruity or buttery, but more intriguing than that. It smells lightly like lemon zest and hazelnuts, and tastes quietly concentrated, like peach skin and almonds.',\n",
       " 'From a winery located below Bernal Heights in San Francisco, this wine offers rich aromas of thick, chewy Meyer lemon pith, lightly toasted sourdough bread, toasted almonds, struck match and the slightest hint of browned butter. The palate is intriguingly tart, oily in texture and quite powerful, with cooked lemon rinds, lemon creme brûlée and marcona almond oil flavors.',\n",
       " \"A saline edge offsets crisp yellow peach and starfruit flavors in this zesty dry Riesling. It's spry and fruity, yet elegant, finishing with surprising persistence.\",\n",
       " \"A single vineyard expression from this winery's newish vineyard, this shows pressed purple flowers, deep blueberries and a touch of tar on the nose. The flavors are dense, dark and framed by strong tannins, with elderberry, pencil lead and deep lilac syrup gaining intrigue from white sage, white pepper and raw beef tones.\",\n",
       " 'Lots of fresh apple flavors, a crisp balance and smooth mouthfeel make this light-bodied wine refreshing and fun to drink. It has some richness on the midpalate and finish, but basically keeps its lively, tangy personality going.',\n",
       " 'Sharp aromas of peach blossoms, honeyed nuts and lemon balm make for a fruity yet biting nose on this blend of 58% Grenache Blanc from Happy Canyon and 42% Viognier from San Luis Obispo County. Ripened stonefruit flavors are cut with a sizzle of acidity and warmth of sea salt and candied Meyer lemon on the palate.',\n",
       " \"A clear, light-bodied wine that's slightly reduced on the nose, this Spring Mountain site provides a tightness of black tea and cherry cola, with a leanness that's hard to miss. Leather, currant and baked bread add additional complexity and intrigue.\",\n",
       " 'A 100% varietal wine entirely from Yountville, this presents a touch of herb and cedar on the entry aromatically, followed by a thickness of tannin that softens in the glass. Big-boned, it finishes strong in tobacco and coffee.',\n",
