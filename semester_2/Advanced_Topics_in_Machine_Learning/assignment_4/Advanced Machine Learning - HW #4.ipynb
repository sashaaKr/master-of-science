       " 'One of the first 1999 Cabs on the market, this wine smells and tastes like the grapes were crushed yesterday. This is what middleweight Cabernet Sauvignon sans oak tastes like: all fresh blackberries and cherries, with undercurrants of espresso and sweet spice. A remarkably tasty wine that should be easy to find: There were 65,000 cases produced.',\n",
       " 'Redolent of sweet plum compote, this semidry Missouri rosé made from native Catawba grapes is an interesting alternative for White Zin fans. Full bodied, with a slightly sugary palate, it finishes with a hint of that foxy Catawba musk. Drink now.',\n",

       " 'Fresh and flowery, with a seductive aromatic profile of gardenia, freesia and honeysuckle that lead to a very likeable, berryish palate. Light-bodied and off-dry, this is a good choice to serve on its own before a meal. Drink now to 2011.',\n",
       " 'A pop style of pink wine that the Peter Mondavi family makes from Zinfandel with minor portions of Chenin Blanc and Muscat. It has a light coral color, mild fruit aromas and semisweet red Popsicle flavors.',\n",
       " \"This is a perfect go-to, everyday Chardonnay, solid and light, if a bit unexciting. The fruit flavors of apple and melon are gentle and soft, and the oak treatment delicately handled. You get a little bit of buttered popcorn, but it's not a night out at the movies.\",\n",
       " 'A popular style, fruity and forward, with the emphasis on citrus, grapefruit and apricot, rather than floral qualities. Sweet fruit set against tangy acid makes it a versatile food wine too.',\n",

       " 'Sweet and medicinal, with candied apricot and honey flavors balanced with crisp acidity.',\n",
       " \"What a great bargain this wine is. It's soft and delicious with blackberry, currant, brown sugar and creamy mocha flavors that lead to a spicy finish. It's easy to drink this Cab with all sorts of foods that pair well with a full-bodied red.\",\n",

       " \"Labeled late harvest, but not terribly sweet, this includes small amounts of Muscat, Gewürztraminer and Chenin Blanc in the blend. Lemony with both citrus rind and sweet candy flavors, it's a useful, off-dry wine with a slightly sugary finish.\",\n",

       " 'These vineyards seem to have been selected for unripe, vegetal grapes. Just manages to scrape by with a veneer of cherries.',\n",
       " 'Quite sweet and fruity, with honeyed, candied stone fruit flavors. The residual sugar is listed as 6%, which qualifies this as a late-harvest style, and it would fit nicely alongside a simple dessert of fresh peaches and butter cookies.',\n",
