       " 'Building on 150 years and six generations of winemaking tradition, the winery trends toward a leaner style, with the classic California buttercream aroma cut by tart green apple. In this good everyday sipping wine, flavors that range from pear to barely ripe pineapple prove approachable but not distinctive.',\n",

The palate is slightly restrained on entry, but opens up to riper notes of cherry and plum specked with crushed pepper. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc is approachable now and ready to be enjoyed.',\n",

This bottling, using fruit sourced from several vineyards in the area, is balanced with just a trace of sweetness in the background (1% residual sugar). This is crisp, straightforward and blessed with notes of pear and lime. Drink it cold.',\n",

The wine hits the palate like a fleshy fist, with an intense, grassy gooseberry flavor that provides plenty of punch. Pair with apricot-glazed roasted chicken.',\n",

       " \"Very deep in color and spicy-smoky in flavor, this full-bodied wine is packed with dark-fruit flavors like blackberry and blueberry. Aromas like grilled beef and spicy flavors like cardamom and smoke give it a bold character that's hard to deny.\",\n",

       " \"Juicy plum, raspberry and pencil lead lead the way in this vineyard designate, a site that's 2,000 feet high. Tobacco and cedar meet a full-bodied hit of oak and puckering tannin, the wine still youthfully wrapped in its full-bodied boldness.\",\n",
       " \"This is the producer's first release of this wine. Fruity aromas of plum and tart cranberry add to its overall sense of lightness and understatement.\",\n",
       " 'This is made from equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with small additions of Malbec. Juicy, it reveals a raisiny quality of ripeness around integrated oak and generous tannin.',\n",

Whether or not that is the case here, the wine has the simple pleasant lightly candied strawberry flavors one might expect from such a technique. It's fruity and undemanding. Drink up.\",\n",
       " 'A healthy addition of 13% Petite Sirah provides added weight and intensity to this wine, a soft, supple and richly conceived combination of smoky black fruit and mocha.',\n",

       " \"All red Bordeaux varieties are represented in this blend, except for Petit Verdot. Together, they offer a simple tannic structure that strengthens a chewiness of leather, tobacco and a touch of cedar. Full bodied, it's a ripe, bold and brawny wine.\",\n",
       " 'Barrel notes are prominent, with aromas of Creamsicle and baking spice. The palate is broad and dry with stone-fruit and barrel flavors. It provides intrigue but the wood seems to get in the way at times.',\n",
       " 'A wisp of bramble extends a savory tone from nose to finish on this otherwise bright bristling wine. Delicate honey tones register as off dry on the palate but balance neatly alongside flavors of freshly pressed apples and pears. The finish is marked by a touch of pencil lead. Drink now through 2020.',\n",
       " \"This blends 20% each of all five red-Bordeaux varieties, showing grapy, plummy flavor that's juicy and soft on the palate. With a core of tobacco, tar and graphite, it complements the fruity with the savory, ending simply and elegantly.\",\n",
       " \"Fresh apple, lemon and pear flavors are accented by a hint of smoked nuts in this bold, full-bodied Pinot Gris. Rich and a bit creamy in mouthfeel yet balanced briskly, it's a satisfying white with wide pairing appeal. Drink now through 2019.\",\n",
       " 'Dusty mineral, smoke and struck flint lend a savory tone to this lean light-bodied Riesling. Off dry in style, the palate offers delicately concentrated flavors of red apple and nectarine off set by tangerine acidity. Drink now through 2021.',\n",
       " 'Intensely smoky tones of struck flint and ash extend throughout this otherwise bright nimble Riesling. The palate boasts freshly pressed apple and pear flavors accentuated by zippy lemon-lime acidity. Drink now through 2021.',\n",
       " 'Lots of spearmint, coyote mint, hot licorice, ginger snaps and Dr Pepper spice up the strawberry fruit of this wine that provides a very herbal take on the grape. Oregano, marjoram, thyme and dill all make a showing on the sip, against a backbone of sweet cherry and blackberry fruit, finishing on cedar.',\n",
       " 'This 100% varietal wine opens in a heady aroma of leather pouch, clove and marshmallow. Both herbaceous and tannic, it begs for more time in the bottle or substantial swirling in the glass.',\n",
       " 'Tar, dried meat, olallieberry and sharp cedar aromas show on this blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon and 49% Merlot. Dried strawberries and plums mix with thyme and dried rose petals on the palate.',\n",
       " \"Poached pears, yellow apples and a touch of butter show on the classic nose of this Chardonnay that holds to steely frame. Very sharp acidity kicks off the sip, where Pink Lady apples and warm vanilla surround a tight minerality. It's both sharp and slightly sweet.\",\n",
       " 'The distinctive nose on this bottling is tight yet tropical, with mango, pineapple, pear skins, orange rinds, dried lime peels and a gin-like juniper all converging. The palate offers a balance between tightly woven texture and ripe tropicality, with lime rinds, mango and petrol touches.',\n",
       " 'Baked red cherry, crushed clove, iron and rose petals make for standard aromas on this bottling, although they are fairly light and simple here. There is a sizzle of acitity on the palate, where juicy strawberry and olallieberry flavors are easy to enjoy, made more complex by graphite and cedar touches.',\n",
       " 'The vineyard is one of the better Chardonnay sources in Alexander Valley, and in this fine vintage it lends ripe pineapple, pear, Key lime pie and Mandarin orange flavors to the wine. Lots of toasty new oak adds buttered toast and vanilla, but the wood influence is in balance. Classic Burgundian-style California Chardonnay, rich and opulent.',\n",

It's fully dry, with potent flavors of baked blackberries, blackcurrants, cola and peppery spices, and the tannins are huge, but negotiable. Demands the richest grilled meats and cheeses.\",\n",
       " 'This sophisticated wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, which accounts for the firm tannins and dense structure as well as most of the blackberries and blackcurrants. Smaller amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc add cherries and violets, while oak contributes smoky complexities. Rich and elegant, the wine provides lovely drinking now.',\n",
       " \"Give this young Cab time in the cellar to come around. Right now, it's fresh and tannic, with primary fruit blackberry and cherry flavors, and the sweet smoky oak hasn't been integrated. Should knit together over the next 4-6 years, at least.\",\n",
       " 'A beautiful wine, sleek, crisp and ultra-dry, with the most refined flavors of petrol, white peach, kaffir lime, apricot skin and minerals. The acidity is very high and palate-cleansing. The wine was half fermented in barrels, half in stainless steel. Sommeliers, buy this by the case, if you can find it.',\n",
       " 'Thick and brooding, this dark, sweetly tannic wine also offers higher-toned elements of cedar, dried herb and graphite. It finds its balance amid a full-bodied density of fruit concentration and girth of structure. Drink now through 2023.',\n",
       " 'Cooked cranberry is spiced with anise, peppercorn and roasted beef slices on this bottling from a vineyard planted by three brothers who are longtime Salinas Valley farmers. The palate shows dark cranberry and raspberry, spiced up by chopped sage, thyme and bay leaf.',\n",
       " \"There's a touch of hot asphalt, pencil lead and miso on the nose of this first vintage from a promising, well-funded project, with dark elderberry fruit and dried dill rounding out the aromas. The palate blends a gamy beef quality with oregano, marjoram, cooked strawberry, baked blackberry and a sesame-oil character.\",\n",
       " \"Black cherry, black plum and black currant are integrated well into the fresh dill and smoke scents on the nose of this wine from one of the region's newest properties. It discloses a rich dark-chocolate sauce character on the palate as well as black-currant-jelly flavors, but most impressive is the lush, sexy and soft mouthfeel.\",\n",
       " \"Smashed blackberry and blueberry fruit are enhanced by burned caramel, heavy slate and touches of soy and smoke on the nose. There's great depth in both body and flavors once sipped, with a layer of fine-grained tannins revealing teriyaki, black plum, boysenberry and touches of lavender.\",\n",
       " 'This wine shows off Yountville fruit at its finest, starting with a floral component to the nose. Spicy, bright and lifted, it coats the palate in ripe berry and cherry, ending with a snap of vanilla.',\n",
       " 'From a promising new project, the nose of this wine is linear and focused, with black raspberry, black licorice, cola, wet sagebrush and rain-on-slate scents. The tactile acidity once sipped creates a fascinating soft buzz on the tongue, with flavors of dried mint, brisk raspberry and cherry tomato. Camphor and eucalyptus add intrigue on the finish.',\n",
       " 'Dark and thick in the glass, this wine shows strong but not bitter tar notes on the nose plus charred beef in a blueberry glaze, wet campfire, bourbon barrel and vanilla. The structure is massive now, gooey with thick tannins and flavors of espresso bean and condensed purple flowers. Judicious acidity ensures strong cellaring potential. Drink 2018–2027.',\n",
       " \"Bradley Brown's appellation blend is a nice entry point to this exciting winery. This wine shows lavish smoked black currant and plum flavors, with aromatically lifting spices of anise and black pepper and a savory roast-beef element. The palate packs lots of pepper and relies on plump black cherry, boysenberry and a dark-chocolate syrup richness.\",\n",
       " 'A hearty blend of 76% Zinfandel and 24% Petite Sirah, this bottling packs a wallop of cinnamon-stick on the nose as well as strawberry puree, licorice and black pepper. Clove, allspice, and nutmeg arise immediately on the sip, backed by baked plum and bay leaf notes.',\n",
       " \"More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose. The palate is grippy in texture and sizzling with mouthwatering acidity, offering lemon rind, grapefruit spritz and petrol flavors. Expect inviting nut and honey-dust flavors to emerge. Drink 2018–2034.\",\n",
       " \"The addition of 15% Petite Sirah takes this bottling to a compelling place, showing barely ripe blackberries, animal fat, smoke, black pepper and a wild clove element on the nose. It's rich and layered on the palate, where chalky tannins support black cherry, grilled beef and mint flavors. This has the bones to last awhile.\",\n",
       " 'A fairly elegant expression of the variety, this wine is bright in cherry kirsch and pretty aromas of rose petal and lavender, structured to age and enjoy with food. Rector Creek Vineyard is just north of Yountville and planted in rocky alluvial soils. Drink now through 2022.',\n",
       " \"This wine is put together from multiple vineyard sources, including the well-known Morelli Lane and Widdoes, all farmed by the Duttons.

       " \"Black as a moonless night, dense in structure, tannic, bone dry and super-peppery, this Syrah isn't offering much relief right now. In all likelihood it will emerge from its cocoon in a few years to offer a wealth of ripe blackberry, currant and carob fruit.\",\n",
       " \"This is a strong, oaky Chardonnay. It's crisp in acidity and forward in pineapple jam, lemon custard and vanilla meringue flavors. If you like the ripe, California style, it's for you.\",\n",

       " 'Rich honeysuckle, marzipan and oak aromas meet bright lemongrass on the nose of this bottling, showing both the fresh and oxidative sides of the grape. Smoked chicken and brioche notes are prominent on the palate, leading to a tangy, botanical, juniper-laced finish.',\n",

       " 'Juicy and austere in understated waves of cranberry and cherry fruit, this wine delivers subtle power and intensity in a leathery-textured package. True to its old vine heritage, it shows a dry dustiness of peppery spice.',\n",
       " 'This blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 21% Syrah, 7% Grenache, 6% Petit Verdot, 5% Tannat and 1% Viognier is tightly wound but likely to improve with time. Opened now, it offers elderberry, black currant, pencil lead and loam on the nose, with lava rock, crème de cassis and kirsch flavors slowing emerging on the palate.',\n",
       " 'This is a big, brawny expression of Grenache, Mourvèdre, Syrah and Counoise, the Grenache playing the dominant role in the blend. It coats the palate in dense raspberry and blueberry fruit, seasoned with pepper and nutmeg. A leathery touch to the texture and lifted acidity keeps it from feeling heavy or overdone.',\n",
       " \"Pithy, with grapefruit and lemon peel flavors, this wine is deceptively crisp and light on the nose, offering a wealth of body and lushness on the palate, accented with nutmeg and peach. It includes 4% Sémillon, partly from the winery's beloved To Kalon vineyard.\",\n",
       " \"Briny green olive notes underlie a tropically ripe, full-bodied expression of the variety. The wine's apple, pineapple and mango fruit is wrapped in toasted oak and moderate acidity.\",\n",
       " 'The deep ruby color belies this wines cool-climate origins. The nose shows more black fruit aromas than is typical for Pinot Noir. The palate is all Pinot, though, with cherry pie filling flavors made more complex by vanilla from toasty new oak. It finishes with some nice mineral and earth notes. Silky tannins allow for immediate consumption but the wine will gain in complexity after a year or two in the cellar.',\n",
       " 'A thoroughly honest effort, opening with lovely quince, apple and lemon fruit. The palate has a crisp lime edge and finishes with a kick of refreshing acidity. Drink now.',\n",

       " 'Orange blossom and flowers lead on this Gewürtz, and on the palate, a citric, lemon edge outweighs the sweet and floral components that would give this wine a prettier edge. Nonetheless, the wine has an attractive, crisp and clean character and will pair well with grilled seafood and poultry.',\n",
       " \"There is an odd, piercing edge to the aromas, a mix of acetic acid and pungent herb, with a hint of diesel. Somehow it's not off-putting, just atypical. The light, tart fruit is a mix of rhubarb and cranberry, very earthy and tasting of dirt and bark in the finish. This could be quite pleasant with a hearty, rustic dish such as beef Bourgogne.\",\n",
       " \"Overly sweet and simple, and something of a disappointment given the winery's past performance, this Syrah tastes like melted cherry jam, stirred with chocolate pie filling and sprinkled with fennel and pepper.\",\n",
       " 'Shows rich, firm mountain tannins and well-ripened, concentrated flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa, and is thoroughly dry. But the wine loses a few points for hot caramelization, which may be partly over-charred oak and partly shriveled, overripe berries, if not both.',\n",
       " \"A little rough and rugged, with jangly tannins and blackberry fruit so ripe it veers into raisins. Very dry, it's probably at its best now.\",\n",

       " 'This sparkling wine starts with a toasty but soft nose, leading into clean but fruity flavors and a refreshing finish. Though an earlier release might have allowed more primary fruit to show through, the wine offers easygoing but elegant enjoyment.',\n",
       " 'Tasty, with pie-filling cherries, blackberries and currants accented with smoky oak, but a little on the soft side. Fully developed, so drink now.',\n",
       " \"This seems as if it was assembled from lesser barrels. It's pleasant, very light, simple and tart; the dominant flavor is cranberry juice.\",\n",
       " 'Cherry pie-filling and boysenberry notes open this impressive blend of Merlot and Petit Verdot. Abundant but velvety tannins give a lift to blueberry and   chocolate tones in the mouth, while the slightly grippy finish shows appealing mixed berry flavors.',\n",

       " \"Spicy and tannic, this inexpensive Pinot from Cherry Hill opens with earthy fruit and leaf flavors—tomato and herb dominate, with just a suggestion of berry. There isn't much in the way of ripeness here, to either fruit or tannins.\",\n",
       " 'Shows the briary, brambly character of Foothills Zin, with an array of wild berry, tobacco, mocha and Asian spice flavors wrapped into finely ground tannins. But the wine is too sweet and candied in the finish. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"The winery has a good track record with this bottling, which shows how well Petite Sirah does in the warmer St. Helena appellation of Napa Valley. This '08 is dryish to moderately sweet in jammy blackberries and blueberries, with a smoked meat, bacon edge. But it's also firmly tannic, which provides a framework for the sweetness.\",\n",
       " \"Esterlina's Pinot is very perfumey, light in body and soul at first, as it gathers steam with a tasty backbone of lush red fruit, spice and plenty of staying power over a meal.\",\n",
       " \"Young, tart and wrapped up tight as a drum, this offers sharp flavors of cranberry and a bit of Campari. It has the heft and polish to open up further with some additional bottle age, but it isn't budging at the moment.\",\n",
       " \"Beaver Creek makes a variation of Fairytale every vintage and this one, sourced from Napa Valley, is 41% Merlot, 36% Zinfandel and 23% Syrah, a mix that seems to work very nicely here. The wine's Zin almost tastes as if it has mountain tannins; the wine is overall herbal and earthy, ripe and sturdy with balanced fruit.\",\n",
       " \"A very good Pinot Noir, rich in cherry, licorice, cola and spice flavors that are wrapped into firm tannins. It's on the forward side, trading complexity and nuance in favor of immediate gratification. Drink now–2014.\",\n",
       " \"A huge, kick butt Zinfandel, packed with sweet berry, bacon, black pepper and smoky cedar flavors. There's absolutely nothing shy about it. Packs a real punch all the way through to the spicy finish. Good price for a Sonoma Zin this classic.\",\n",
       " 'Quite a good Cabernet, showing the elegance and ripe fruitiness you expect from Napa, in a style for drinking now. Drily tannic, it shows classic blackberry and blueberry flavors.',\n",
       " 'Fruity, forward and quite refreshing, this has appealing black cherry fruit with a light candy flavor. The balancing tannins add sufficient depth and weight to allow this a few more years in the cellar.',\n",
       " \"This is another fine Pinot from Cambria, showing the winery's great price-quality ratio. Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices. It's bone dry, and also quite tannic, but you can enjoy it now with big, rich lamb and beef dishes, or a wild mushroom risotto. Otherwise, it will continue to improve for at least eight years.\",\n",
       " 'Bella Vida replaces the Abbey Ridge bottling and does so with pizzazz. The best of the 2011 releases, this is a beautiful expression of grapes grown on red clay soils, with refined, deeply penetrating flavors of ripe raspberries. Smooth, supple and long, with uncommon purity, it finishes with a kiss of chocolate from 18 months in one-quarter new oak barrels.',\n",
       " 'While delicious now with flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and oak, all showered with tart, citrusy acidity, this wine also has a great future. Give it 6–8 years to evolve in the bottle for further complexity.',\n",
       " \"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is so rich and decadent, with milk chocolate, blackberry and new French oak flavors. Made by celebrity winemaker Philippe Melka, it's soft and approacheable on the palate and widely appealing. Your best bet is to drink up now.\",\n",

       " \"Soft, light in body and easy to drink, this Sangiovese, from the Napa estate vineyard, is delicious in raspberry, red currant, licorice, bacon and spice flavors. It's somewhat ephemeral, an instantly pleasant wine to drink especially with cured meats, olives, hard cheeses.\",\n",
       " 'A good, clean, tart and lightly spicy all-stainless style. Cool climate fruit puts the accent on lime and lemon flavors, keeps the alcohol low (13.3%), and makes this a fine match to shellfish, white fish and light pasta dishes.',\n",
       " 'Muted at first, this wine opens up nicely with time. Sweet, ripe and easy on the finish, its core is full of black pepper and clove. The grapes are sourced from several distinctive vineyards in Mendocino County. Drink it with a steak.',\n",
       " 'A good wine to drink now for its sweet, ripe berry and mocha flavors and smoky coat of oak. It has smooth tannins and a spicy finish. Give it a good decant to let it breathe for a few hours.',\n",

       " \"This white has a light, delicate nose of citrus and apricot. On the palate it's smooth and balanced with lush apricot and spice flavors. A touch of acidity gives the wine lift. A lingering finish adds to its poise. Pair with a creamy cheese or sip alone.\",\n",

       " \"For 2014, the Weber is the star of a very fine Winderlea lineup. Dark and deeply concentrated, it's jammed with black cherry fruit, annotated with anise and showing a hint of gunmetal.

       " \"A first-rate wine, with well-ripened flavors of blackberries, espresso, cola, tea, and bitter chocolate, but made more interesting by fresh acidity not often seen in today's better Merlots. This cool-climate wine also has sturdy tannins that suggest mid-term aging.\",\n",
       " \"A great and versatile food wine. Its polished flavors of lime, fig and apricot are drizzled with Oriental spices and smoky oak. One of California's  most consistent wines, and rich enough to stand in for Chardonnay.\",\n",

       " \"The alcohol is nice and low in this dry Pinot Noir. It has a silky texture and complex flavors of red cherries, persimmons, cola and spices. Acidity is great but there's something slightly off, suggesting a trace of unripeness. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"This smooth, lush Cabernet is brimming with blackberry, black currant, blueberry cedar and spice flavors. It's classic Cabernet. You'll find quite a scour of acidity running through the middle, which suggests this wine should pair with rich, fatty meats.\",\n",
       " 'Tart and lively, this medium-bodied Sangiovese was co-fermented with small amounts of Syrah and Viognier. The Viognier contributes scents of citrus and stone fruit, which add some welcome complexity.',\n",
       " 'Produced by Three Rivers for celebrity winemaker Geoff Tate, the Insania is actually rather tame. Pretty fruit flavors of berry, cherry and plum introduce the wine gracefully, then run into some stiff, drying, chalky tannins.',\n",
       " \"This is intensely aromatic, with loads of tropical fruit, apple blossom and white peach notes on the nose and palate. It's fresh, tasty and big in body, yet deftly balanced. Soft, lemony acidity on the midpalate gets a boost of citrus rind and saline on the finish.\",\n",
       " 'This El Dorado wine opens with aromas of sweet floral jasmine and is very pretty through and through. Its acidity sings perfectly through the middle of the wine, lifting the flavors of apple and dried apricot as well as the notes of lemon and lime on the finish. This should pair with a range of midweek dinners.',\n",
       " \"This wine has the variety's trademark notes of herb, green bell pepper, with a woodsy qulaity. This is a full-bodied effort, bearing a long, spicy finish.\",\n",

       " \"Sauvignon Blanc has been a consistent performer for Hanna, usually yielding a rich, ripe wine with brisk acidity. The '11 is one of their best efforts. It's tart, clean and savory, with the pineapple, tangerine and Meyer lemon flavors touched with a slight sweetness.\",\n",
       " 'Medium bodied, this sharply defined wine brings in plenty of notes of herb, root and earth around its light berry fruit. It captures the defining flavors of Wahluke Slope Syrah in a somewhat muted style, reflecting the abbreviated growing season.',\n",
       " 'This is a mix of fruit from both warm and cool vineyards, crafting a clean, fresh, lightly herbal wine with a pleasing dusty character. Hints of cocoa and toast annotate the tart berry fruit, with a thread of smoke and chalk running through the tannins.',\n",
       " \"This would be a straightforward Bordeaux red blend if not for the 5% Petite Sirah within. Together, it's 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec as well, sourced from Howell Mountain and valley floor sites. Dusty and herbal, the wine is thick and sizably tannic, with dense black fruit, leather and coffee.\",\n",
       " 'Flint and smoke aromas show strongly on this bottling, alongside hints of lemon balm and a rustic apple cider vinegar savory kick. Tangy smoked tangerine flavors show on the energized sip, where a unique sandalwood smoky quality plays with more cider-like tang.',\n",
       " 'Big tannins support the layers of extracted, concentrated fruit that leans red into cherry, cassis and currant. Char and vanilla speak for the oak.',\n",
       " 'Delicate in cranberry and strawberry, this wine is highlighted in uplifted acidity and plenty of length and breadth within its medium-bodied structure. A pleasing streak of cardamom is consistent throughout, as accents of forest floor and cola figure in.',\n",
       " 'This is a relatively thick and dense wine, grippy in tannin and oak at first, youthful and desiring of time and air. Beyond its strength, its shows the beginnings of delicacy and grace, commingling raspberry with clove and tea.',\n",
       " \"This is a soft, smooth and earthy wine, still unraveling from its youth, that's crisp and fresh in acidity. Chewy still in texture, it offers a glorious celebration of red cherry, rhubarb, tea and clove.\",\n",
       " 'Deliciously fruity but also well-structured, this full-bodied wine has excellent concentration and good balance. Effusive aromas of blueberry and black cherry lead to opulent but not overripe berry flavors that are lightly accented by clove and cinnamon nuances.',\n",
       " 'Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff.',\n",
       " 'This is a delicate yet flavorful take on this grape, from a biodynamic, cool-climate vineyard. Light red plum and hibiscus aromas meet with sweet herbs and cinnamon spice on the nose. The lithe palate offers candied strawberry with thyme, anise and touches of garden herbs, with that red fruit flavor carrying deep into the finish. Would pair great with spicy food.',\n",
       " \"The Sims is amped up in 2014, dark and thick and showing a roasted character. Mocha, black tea and Kahlua flavors push the palate into a gritty charred mode. It's delicious, liquorous, and suitable for smoky ribs or a juicy burger. Drink now through 2020.\",\n",
       " \"There's a whiff of volatility upon opening, then a rush of bright, tangy orange and cherry fruit. The 20% new oak aging does not really come through in scent or flavor.

       " 'Just 8% of this reserve spent time in new oak, putting the emphasis on juicy jammy flavors of cranberry fruit. It rolls into sour cherry, some citrus and a most refreshing, clean and vivid mouthfeel. Drink now and into the mid-2020s.',\n",
       " \"From the sought-after site on Westside Road, this wine delivers a nuanced, elegant expression of juicy red cherry, plum, pomegranate and light, compelling spice. With a depth of body and soft, integrated tannin, it's complex without being overpowering, finishing in a mix of sautéed mushroom and forest floor.\",\n",
       " 'One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully. The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least.',\n",
       " 'Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) consults here. This brings a blend of clones from the estate vineyard, with ample new wood still showing through. Black fruits and a vein of coffee are also in the mix, with a balanced, somewhat muscular mouthfeel. This has the strength to stand up to a lightly blackened grilled seafood filet.',\n",
       " 'Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through. Give it a good decanting and it will start to smooth out.',\n",
       " 'Black plum, charred wood, coffee syrup and cracked black pepper show on the excellently bright nose of this bottling. The flavors are equally intriguing, with umami touches of charred beef along with rosemary, bay leaf, olie and more black pepper.',\n",
       " 'Merlot (63%) takes the lead on this blend followed by Cabernet Sauvignon (23%) and Cabernet Franc. The aromas seem somewhat wound up at present, with notes of wood spice, vanilla and fresh herb. The palate is über-smooth, showing a fine sense of balance and polish.',\n",
       " 'A 100% varietal wine, this offers upfront structure and gravelly texture, its tannins robust. The medium-bodied ripeness allows plenty of room for dried herb and cedar, accents to the bolder notions of black raspberry jam and coffee.',\n",
       " \"This is sourced from 30-year-old Wädenswil vines from a vineyard in the Elkton AVA. It's complex and compelling, showing layers of stone, strawberry, citrus, chocolate and sassafras. It's an elegant wine, well proportioned and modest in scope, but delicious.\",\n",
       " \"Bright pomegranate and dried strawberry notes start the aromas on this bottling and then descend into more brooding cola, smoked herbs, cinnamon and spicy hibiscus.

       " 'A touch of earthy funk shows at first on the nose of this bottling, laced throughout the dark cranberry, pomegranate, crushed grapeseeds and a lavish layer of violets. The palate is heavily spiced with clove, gingerbread, a touch of juniper, lots of earthy sagebrush and a strong cranberry fruit, all seasoned by an iron-powered minerality.',\n",
       " 'From one of the more exciting and westernmost vineyards in the region, this bottling shows earthy, gamey aromas alongside ripe red and purple fruits, pairing plum and black cherry with minty, musky herbs. The palate shows dried olive, tart orange peels, red plums, baked figs and pine needles, proving deliciously savory and intense.',\n",
       " 'Strong elements of black pepper and smoky oak beg for steak to be paired with this 100% varietal wine.

       " \"This is a gorgeous wine, blended with 8% Merlot, 1% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec, and aged entirely in new French oak. Juicy waves of cassis and red currant are accented by dark chocolate, ultimately showcasing a lush, plush yet structured palate. It's decadent now, but should age well through 2022.\",\n",
       " \"Crisp green apple is the star in this well-made, balanced and elegant wine, that's tangy yet smooth, with a voluptuous tease of anise. Approachably structured, the complexity of the texture and lurking layers of further flavor suggest letting this wine open slowly to unveil its true self, and allowing it to linger on the palate.\",\n",
       " 'Deep aromas of dried strawberries and blueberries meet with hot bricks, dried meats, purple flowers, a touch of smoke and secondary notes of truffle on the nose of this delicious smelling and tasting wine. The layers of flavor on the palate range from black cherry to milk chocolate, framed by chalky tannins.',\n",
       " \"This is the producer's highest and most westerly vineyard site. It holds back from the start, still tightly wound and somewhat reduced on the nose. As it opens, ethereal layers of wild strawberry, green tea and lacings of herb and white pepper unveil to tremendous effect.\",\n",

       " 'From the gorgeous, mighty Pagani, planted in 1895, comes this powerfully rich and refined wine, a study in woodsy rusticity and layers of fig, blackberry and a stick of cinnamon. Full bodied and luxurious on the palate, a lithe jolt of acidity rears its head just before the finish, trying to compete with the licorice and leather. Drink now through 2020.',\n",
       " 'Discovery Vineyard Cab makes up most of this wine, with just a splash of Champoux vineyard Franc to fill it out.

       " \"It's fun to rattle off a few of the numerous aromas and flavors in this exotic but subtle wine: tangerine, pastry cream, blanched almonds and a touch of honey. The wine is refreshing, dry and nicely braced with acidity, but at the same time rather broad and soothing in texture. In other words, beautifully balanced and wonderfully complex.\",\n",
       " \"This mostly Syrah blends in 6% Grenache, combining the two grapes from the property's estate into an opaque, juicy expression of black licorice, tar, cigar, grilled mushrooms atop a meaty steak and plenty of black pepper. Big and bold in every sense of the word, it retains just enough acidity to maintain an inviting nature and beguiling floral backbone.\",\n",
       " 'As the name makes clear, this wine is made from a head-pruned, older block of very unlikely Syrah at the estate property, as seductive as rare.

       " \"There's magic in this 65% Petit Verdot and 35% Sangiovese combination. This shows concentrated cherry and kirsch aromas, touches of shiitake and porcini mushrooms and plenty of turned, wet earth aromas.

       " 'Softened by 6% Merlot, this lovely concoction opens with a waft of smoky cigar box, becoming a bold, loud expression of the variety dotted in classic notes of cassis and cedar. A luxuriously velvety texture is the standout, though, supported by great structure and length.',\n",

       " 'From a knoll in Carneros, oft thought of as chilly for Cabernet, this wine exhibits cooler aspects of the variety, from pencil lead and cedar to dried herb.

       " 'This wine opens with a confectionary nose, slowly unleashing its thick, concentrated richness of dark cherry and cassis on the palate. Between the layers are grippy tannins and shakes of meaty leather and black pepper. This could stand some time in a decanter or swirling in the glass before enjoying.',\n",
       " 'This is a particularly expressive wine with lots of personality. It opens with aromas of cherry, tea and wood smoke, and tastes very dry and structured with vivid fruit acidity and tannins. Sour cherry and raspberry provide the fruit flavors.',\n",

       " 'This blend from a newer Westside Paso winery offers blackberry, charred pine and sour cherry aromas. The palate is driven by pine sap, charred game and sharp herbs such as oregano and rosemary, and would be a great way to spice up a steak dinner.',\n",
       " 'A nice tarry funk along with dried mint and menthol cigarette scents characterize the nose of this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Syrah and 4% Petite Verdot. The creosote sense carries to the palate, meeting with black cherry, dried bouquet garni and quite grippy tannins.',\n",
       " 'Estate bottled, this assemblage of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot opens with a flurry of coconut flake and herb, followed by ripe, rich layers of dark berry and black tea. The wine has power yet also possesses an elegance that stands out, finishing with a taste of dark caramel.',\n",
       " 'Creamy and fresh, this is made from estate-grown grapes, fermented in a mix of stainless steel and neutral barrels. The fruit flavors blend jicama, melon and pear, with a touch of sweetness. It finishes with a hint of honeysuckle.',\n",
       " 'This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting. Aromas include pressed kiwi and a sour pucker of lime, and the broiled pear flavors prove easy drinking, if not exceedingly complex.',\n",
       " \"Smooth-drinking, this offers soft, mellow flavors of melon and pear. Light but persistent, it's a clean, fresh and appealing selection, best enjoyed now.\",\n",
       " 'The pretty fruit flavors suggest relatively young vines, bringing light cherry to the front and center. Hints of marzipan, a flash of finishing heat and subtle chalkiness run through the finish. Another year or two of bottle age should continue to improve this one.',\n",
       " \"There's a substantial earthiness to this Chardonnay, grown in a relatively cool estate vineyard. Vibrant on the palate in ripe apple and lemon, it offers medium weight and body, with a crispness to the finish and a food-friendly nature.\",\n",
       " 'Sea salt, Bosc pear, apple cider, squeezed lemon and shreds of vanilla frame a leaner nose on this wine from mid-Monterey County. The cider element carries to the rather pungent palate, proving quite high-toned and acidic with some minerality, grapefruit peel grip and long-lasting vibrancy on the finish.',\n",
       " \"This wine offers notes of toasted vanilla bean, herbs and red fruit. It's broad in feel while the fruit flavors are elegant in style, with the supple feel bringing much of the enjoyment.\",\n",
       " \"Far and away the freshest and most interesting of the three vintages submitted for review. The fruit retains more of its youthful gloss; it's riper and shows more cherry character, along with bright, spicy highlights. The tannins are proportionate and less earthy and herbal. This is no barn-burner, but it's a good quaffer.\",\n",
       " 'This is a pretty good buy for a Merlot that shows lots of polish and sophistication. It has savory black cherry, currant, cola and spice flavors. The tannins are a little rugged and green, so it loses some points.',\n",
       " 'Shows plenty of lush, ripe fruit, wrapped in soft tannins and balanced with crisp acids. The forward black cherry, red licorice, orange and smoky vanilla flavors are rich, and the price makes it a great value.',\n",
       " \"Estancia produces solid, savory Pinot Grigios at a fair price, and they even dropped their price last year. This one's a little off-dry, with crisp acidity and pleasant citrus, peach and honeysuckle flavors.\",\n",
       " \"This is the kind of wine someone serves at a big party, maybe in paper cups, along with the canapes, and you're delighted because it's actually pretty good. It's dry, soft and chocolaty, with a rich undertow of blackberries and currants.\",\n",
       " 'Composed, complex and complete, this mellow wine is very comfortable in its skin. Touches of oak, tobacco, dried plum and cardamom fill the aroma, and ripe but not overripe black cherry, tamarind and cola flavors flood the palate, supported by fine-grained tannins and medium-full body.',\n",
       " 'This wine offers astounding quality for the price, a juicy expression of fruit and spice with a depth of firm resolved tannin, lively acidity and layers of black cherry and cola. Approachable and delicious, it hits the mark on every level being light bodied and refreshingly balanced while complex.',\n",
       " \"With its distinctive black label, this reserve is set apart from the winery's expanding lineup of Pinots. It shows more oak-derived flavors, along with ripe plum and cherry fruit. Streaks of espresso, vanilla and chocolate come through, suggesting it will only improve with a hearty decant or additional bottle age. Drink now through the mid-2020s.\",\n",
       " \"Sourced from the estate's original 1999 plantings, this is a chewy, majestic, earthy and deeply dark wine. Its black fruit is ribbed wtih iron, licorice, coffee and graphite notes and framed by earthy tannins that lend texture. It drinks bigger than its listed alcohol would suggest.\",\n",
       " 'This single vineyard wine is a blend of six separate blocks, each planted to a different clone. It deftly combines savory herb flavors with ripe Bing cherry fruit. The tannins are polished, textured and balanced, leading into a long finish that leaves a final impression of composted earth.',\n",
       " 'Always impressive in its grasp of power and grace, this white is memorable from start to finish, beginning with a dark golden-hay color that dazzles in the glass. A strong floral component of jasmine invites on the nose, while sparkling acidity maintains a freshness amidst the integrated oak and delicious flavors of honeyed pear and crème brûlée.',\n",
       " 'Irresistably delicious and reminiscent of cru Burgundy, this laser-focused effort features bright Meyer lemon, tangerine and peach flavors, with plenty of juicy acidity. It grows deeper and richer as it breathes—and seems to disappear way too quickly once opened.',\n",
       " \"This winery is earning a place among Oregon's best with its top tier wines, like this one. Complex and loaded with bee pollen, crisp apple, lime zest, seabreeze and toasted cracker notes, it leaves you breathless the longer it breathes.\",\n",
       " \"As characterful as the dry version but with lower alcohol and a slight hint of sweetness, this boasts powerful tangerine, quince and Meyer lemon fruit. Its electric acidity keeps it vivid and beautifully balanced. Delicious now, it's also cellar-worthy.\",\n",
       " 'More tart than sweet, this delicious wine is packed with lemon drop, candied pineapple and tangerine fruit. The acidity is in perfect proportion with the slightly sweet palate, giving it a vivid mouthfeel that extends into the finish and offers versatility for food pairing.',\n",
       " \"Lighter in color, this wine is aromatic and expressive, with notes of fire pit, blood, black olive tapenade, sea salt, black pepper, cured meat, nori, crushed flowers and umami. The palate brings soft, lithe, focused notes of earth and savory flavors that shimmer on the salty finish. It's all about delicacy but the aroma and flavor expression is compelling. Give it some time in the cellar or decant.\",\n",
       " 'Estate-grown, this 100% varietal wine impresses in its total embrace of succulent blackberry, plum and mocha goodness, built upon a mountain of structured tannin and quiet oak. Touches of milk chocolate play along the palate as it rides along a velvety roadway, finishing soft and silky.',\n",
       " 'From dry-farmed 40-year-old vines perched along the Rutherford Bench, this impressive offering is sanguine and elegantly balanced, a showcase of cranberry, raspberry and milk chocolate. Refined acidity contributes to an overall lightness, with dried herb and dust lingering on the finish.',\n",
       " \"All Trisaetum's dry Rieslings feel a notch riper in this warm year, to good effect. Meticulous blending of individual lots, some aged in oak, brings layers of complexity and helps differentiate each cuvée. Concentrated pear, peach and papaya flavors are on display here, with tangy acidity and superb length and richness. It's dry, to be sure, but also brilliantly fruity.\",\n",
       " 'Smoky, with bursts of sage and celery root, this is a wine that is unabashedly earthy, spicy, bold and juicy at its core. Light-bodied and delicate, the palate shows beautiful floral undertones. This is a complex and beguiling bottling that should hold well for years to come.',\n",
       " \"The aromas of this wine leap from the glass, with notes of orange peel, potpourri, smoked meat, spice, fresh herb, stem, ash and plum. It's expressive, but still wound up. The flavors are focused, concentrated and savory, bringing a sense of intensity and richness but also lightness. The balance is exquisite.\",\n",
       " 'This is an impressively well-crafted, and beautiful wine, blended with 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Malbec, the main variety mountain-grown on Pritchard Hill. It shines in big, bold and powerfully built black fruit and leather. Dusty, firm tannins and a taste of graphite, coffee and tar are also highly evident. The finish is tart and seasoned in white pepper. Best enjoyed 2023 through 2033.',\n",
       " 'From a three-acre spot known to get a hearty dose of fog, this wine speaks to cool-climate character, unveiling crisp floral layers of dried sage and white pepper from the get-go. Those aspects are joined by rose, lavender and cranberry-rhubarb on the palate, finishing with subtle offerings of mushroom and forest floor.',\n",
       " 'From vines planted in 1976, this aromatic wine shows the depth that old vines can bring. Strawberry, cola, butter (from 14 months in 50% new French oak), wild cherry and more come into focus, and although delicate, they last and last on the palate. The finish is spectacular.',\n",
       " \"This reserve-level wine from the Roserock vineyard, Domaine Drouhin's recent Eola-Amity Hills planting, is compelling. Dense and fragrant, it boasts a beguiling mix of rose, cocoa powder and Asian spice, like a magic carpet ride of flavor. A finishing note of chocolate-covered orange peel is the pièce de résistance.\",\n",
       " \"The winery shows its prowess with making delicious, affordable larger-production wines with this bright and easy drinking Cabernet, a study in soft tannins, juicy cranberry/currant fruit and composed structure. It's a good one to stock up on at the price and quality.\",\n",
       " 'This super-smooth late harvest effort is perfectly balanced among sugar/alcohol/acid components. Lively and rich, it offers concentrated flavors of limoncello, apricot and candied peaches. Drink it chilled for best effect.',\n",
       " 'Creamy and well-integrated, this offers personality and style. The crisp bite of green apple and lemon curd are textured and long-lasting. With its overall balance, it is a fantastically versatile pairing option.',\n",
       " 'With the scent of watermelon chapstick leading the way, this is a fruit-forward wine you want to kiss. Other aromas on the sweet-and-spicy nose include stewed plums and a dill-led herbal element. The flavors of red fruits and brown spice make for a completely delicious experience.',\n",
       " \"There's a ying-yang of rich crème brûlée, lemon curd and toasted oak amid good acidity and fresh apple and pear fruit, with inviting aromas to boot. Creamy and crisp it'll serve well aside all manner of seafood, like fresh-caught trout.\",\n",
       " 'With alcohol in the low-moderate range, this immaculately fresh wine is flush with juicy gooseberry and grapefruit. It carries the varietal hallmarks of fresh herbs, notably chive, and a balancing lick of minerality.',\n",
       " \"Boushey and Red Willow are the vineyards that contribute to this 100% varietal Cabernet Franc. There's excellent concentration to the brambly, bright, blackberry fruit, and some sharp acidity to underscore it. It's pure varietal and should continue to improve 2019–2021.\",\n",
       " 'Fresh, gushing fruit flavors such as raspberry, red cherry and boysenberry fill out this expressive and well-balanced wine. It is sweetly fruity in aroma, full-flavored, full-bodied, firm and dry in texture but not heavy. It craves ribs or wood-fired pizza.',\n",
       " 'Distinct crushed lava rock aromas meet with dust, cinnamon, cola and Dr Pepper on this blend of 28% Syrah, 22% Grenache, 17% Cinsault, 17% Mourvèdre and 16% Carignane. Light red fruits of cranberry and slight strawberry show on the palate that dives into serious tannins quickly.',\n",
       " \"Coming from the warm 2013 vintage, this is an aromatic offering, with notes of pineapple, kiwi, herbs and oak spices (40% barrel fermented). It's creamy in feel, but with tart, vibrant acidity that keeps the palate fresh and lively.\",\n",
       " \"One of a string of great values made at Terravant near Santa Barbara. Attractively oaky, it's full-bodied, full-flavored and just tannic enough to make it a good pairing for rich meat or cheese courses. It is deep in color, with a slightly tawny rim. It smells like wood smoke and grilled bread, tastes deep as blackberry and delivers cherry flavors that linger on the finish.\",\n",
       " 'Rich cherry and spicy black pepper introduce the nose to this wine from the Adelaida district. The flavors explore the more nuanced, not overly jammy side of the grape, with tart acidity and a good tannic backbone ensuring a long life. Decent now, but better to drink 2018–2022.',\n",
       " \"While ebulliently peachy and floral on the nose, savory notes of dried reeds and savory herbs overwhelm the fruit flavors in this dry, light-bodied Riesling. It's crisp and refreshingly composed, but finishes a bit short. Drink now.\",\n",
       " \"Red apple, spice and honey aromas lead to medium-sweet fruit flavors. It brings some appeal but the concentration doesn't seem all there.\",\n",
       " 'This wine is an unusual blend of Touriga (38%), Tinto Cão (20%), Tempranillo (18%), Petit Verdot (15%) and Souzão. Alcohol aromas show prominently along with dark fruit. The fruit flavors seem dried out, juxtaposed by the sweetness of the wine, with the tannins having a real sense of grip.',\n",
       " 'This wine is tightly wound and thickly colored. Full bodied in style, it shows plenty of oak influence, aged in entirely French oak for 16 months, 42% of it new. Cranberry and sour cherry dominate in terms of fruit, with an underlying agenda of clove and tea.',\n",
       " 'This is a challenging mix of substantially puckering tannins and herbaceous notes, dotted in black peppercorns. The fruit is elusive.',\n",
       " 'This Zinfandel-dominant blend also contains Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah in sizable amounts, rounded out by a handful of Merlot. Relatively light bodied, it has a muted nose. The flavors lean towards overripe, more dried fruit than fresh.',\n",
       " \"An uncomplicated combination of red and black berry bramble with an overlay of coconut shavings provides a ripeness of fruit atop sweetened tannins and dull oak in this wine. It's made to be medium bodied and enjoyable now.\",\n",
       " \"Pronounced notes of butter, cheese and canned cream corn dominate this savory Chardonnay. It's a rather fat, cream-textured wine but sunny tangerine acidity and fresher notes of apple and pear flavors do get a peek through the midpalate.\",\n",
       " \"Aromas like green apples and lemons, and herbal flavors make this wine refreshing and balanced toward the lean side. It's rather light bodied and crisp in texture.\",\n",
       " 'After 34 months in previously used French barrels, this wine has a brownish rim. It smells like pepper, clove and cinnamon and tastes like dried fruit. Considerable tannins contribute to an astringent mouthfeel.',\n",
       " 'This Meritage is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Tasting quite ripe, it has a burnt sage and cedar undertone. Tannins hit on the back of the palate with power and not much finesse.',\n",
       " \"The aromas of cinnamon, kelp, and dried fruit are unusual and don't seem in harmony. The gamy flavors bring some appeal but don't entirely come together.\",\n",
       " \"Coffee grinds and caramel mingle with hints of popcorn and dried herbs in this curious blend of white grapes which have been aged Sherry-style in a solera. Whiffs of dried fruit and caramel are enticing, but the palate juxtaposes craggy acidity with mouthfeel that's dampening and flat.\",\n",
       " 'This is spicy and sharp, with high-toned fruit flavors of berry and currant. Acids are strong and provide good focus, with a spicy/peppery note resonating through the finish.',\n",
       " \"Old vine Petite Sirah fortified with brandy in the Port style, this very sweet wine could benefit from some time in the bottle. It's quite rich in chocolate, black currant and spice flavors wrapped into smooth, thick tannins, with a burn of alcohol on the finish.\",\n",
       " 'From Gallo, a two-county blend with some real elegance and style. The Cab is dry, soft and full-bodied, with lingering blackberry, currant, licorice and spice flavors. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"With its peppery spices and briary, brambly notes of ripe wild berries, this wine tastes more like Zinfandel than Merlot. It's not true to the variety, but it is a solid red wine, dry and full-bodied.\",\n",
       " \"In keeping with the winery's other red wine releases, the Cedarosa matches tart berry fruits to lush barrel flavors of butter and toast. It's approachable and somewhat monolithic.\",\n",
       " 'A little heavy and ripe for a Pinot Noir, this bottling shows pie-filling flavors of cherries, blackberries and currants, with a candied chocolate-covered mint sweetness. It also seems overly soft. Drink now.',\n",
       " \"Stemmler's record is spotty with this bottling. This '05 is a little too ripe, soft and heavy, but the chocolate-inspired red currant, cola and licorice flavors are lip-smackingly good.\",\n",
       " 'Honeylike aromas, ripe peach and apple flavors and rather full body give this wine good depth and breadth. It seems like just the thing for a picnic or to serve with cheese at a party.',\n",
       " 'Crisp green-apple freshness blends with hints of butter and vanilla for a nicely balanced, un-oaky, medium-bodied wine at a very reasonable price.',\n",
       " 'Though aged in neutral oak, this wine opens with scents and flavor hints of toast and butter. The fruit is clean and generic, like a fresh apple, but the mouthfeel lacks life and fades into a flat finish. Drink up.',\n",
       " \"There's a solid concentration of red and black berries to the nose of this wine, with tar and soy sauce giving depth. Solid tannic grip on the palate offers support to the array of dark cherry and blackberry alongside sandalwood and smoke.\",\n",
       " 'This wine is very good in a ripe, almost-sweet style. It smells and tastes like blackberry pie, has full fruit flavors and a smooth, rich texture without noticeable tannins.',\n",
       " \"There's a touch (17%) of new oak here, which adds flavors of caramel and vanilla to the rather tart and simple fruit. It falls into the generic yellow/green apple style, with hints of arugula.\",\n",
       " 'This is an assertive, flavorful and robust wine, with a medium to full body, a mouthfilling texture and fine-beaded bubbles. A creamy viscosity and wonderful layers of butter, apple, vanilla and ginger make for a delicious palate.',\n",
       " 'Black in color, this heavy concentrated wine is thick in black pepper and clove, with underlying streaks of cedar. Well structured, it unfurls depths of black cherry, currant and vanilla as it develops in the glass, finishing a full bodied as it started.',\n",
       " \"This blend works in commingling 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Franc and 4% each of Malbec and Petit Verdot, all from the producer's vineyard. Caramel sparks a richness against which herbal, woody tannins speak. The body expansive and full, and the finish awash in spicy clove.\",\n",
       " 'Dark purple flowers and tart boysenberry paste show on the nose of this intensely concentrated wine, alongside pencil shavings, bay lead and a lot of iron minerality. More bay leaf and pine needle show on the herbally full and texturally grippy palate, giving minty spice to the dark fruit flavors.',\n",
       " 'Dark and deep aromas of black cherry, clove, allspice, black pepper and char make for a hearty impression on this appellation blend. The palate is also rich and powerful, its thick mouthfeel showing black cherry, cocoa, vanilla and a touch of asphalt. A rocky minerality and minty finish complete the experience.',\n",
       " 'Complex and composed, this vineyard-designate wine is brightly decorated in flavors of grapefruit pith and lemon zest, with zippy acidity. As it develops in the glass, richer elements of peach and apricot flesh out the palate with succulent aplomb.',\n",
       " \"From the Barton family's estate vineyard, this is a very dark Syrah with aromas of blackberry, balsamic, lavender and thyme flowers. There's a rich blueberry flavor at the core of the palate, where cocoa shavings, tense tannins and a lilac florals combine for a multi-layered wine.\",\n",
       " \"Scott Sampler's experimentation with extra long macerations seem to imbue even more of a sense of place to his wines. In this case, that translates to very purple aromas of grape Jolly Ranchers, violet oil and warm black licorice. An exotic Indian-candy spice shows on the tip of the sip, leading into rich blueberry and fresh purple-flower flavors, with coffee and cocoa on the finish.\",\n",
       " \"Lilacs and wisteria combine for a floral and approachable nose in this clonal study, which is also loaded with clove, peppercorn, rosemary and elderberry aromas. It's soft and lush on the palate, with rich plum and black cherry flavors leveled by notes of anise, potpourri, fresh mint and Earl Grey tea.\",\n",
       " 'Extremely lively peppercorn aromas meet with black plum, blackberry, dried violets and lavender on the nose of this bottling by vineyard manager Ruben Solorzano. The palate is spicy with cracked pepper, rosemary oil and pine needles, which mix with the blackberry and elderberry fruits. Roasted lamb flavors also make an appearance against tannins that rise up in the finish.',\n",
       " 'After three years en tirage, this well-evolved wine is heady and floral, made to highlight and celebrate diversity. Creamy and lush on the palate, it has a rounded richness of stone fruit. Made predominantly from Pinot Noir, it has an accentuated taste of strawberry shortcake.',\n",
       " 'What a treat to find a great rendition of this rare varietal. Concentrated black-fruit flavors pair beautifully with aromatic oak accents in this bold and complex wine. It has plenty of tannins to support the intense blackberry and blueberry flavors, while enticing cinnamon, cumin and leather come up in the aroma and last through the lingering finish.',\n",
       " 'Dark gold in color, a strong note of apple skin gives way to tight acidity on the entry of this wine. As it develops in the glass, it becomes plush and fleshy, imparting complex elements of candied quince and orange blossom.',\n",
       " \"Marc Piro continued to hone his craft under Jim Clendenen at Au Bon Climat, and that expertise shows in this bottling, which combines Presqu'ile and Bien Nacido Vineyards to produce a wine that's both zesty in the underripe style yet full of fruit as well. Aromas of wild oregano, thyme, tapenade and red cherry lead into a palate full of tantalizing acidity, with tart Montmorency cherry, tangy tomato and fennel spice.\",\n",
       " \"This elegant bottling by two service-industry veterans shows tons of potpourri, dried lavender, black raspberry and red plum on the nose. The flavors are quite broad and inviting, with hibiscus and ripe tomato meshing into juniper and clove. It's light in mouthfeel and weight, but well structured.\",\n",
       " 'Elegant and beautiful aromas of Montmorency cherry, tart orange peel and balsamic fig reduction sauce prove precise and show some mature vine age. Roasted fig flavors meet with salt and pepper seasonings on the palate, which is well structure and full of bright acidity.',\n",
       " 'Extreme concentration combined with a velvety texture make this inky-dark wine made from Tannat and Dornfelder compelling to taste. The color is black with a thin ruby rim while black cherry, cedar and tobacco fill the aroma and crème de cassis meets espresso on the palate. The mouthfeel is polished as very fine-grained tannins blend with a rich viscosity.',\n",
       " 'From the Carneros-based producer with its roots in Spain, this succeeds in its velvety smooth texture, juicy fruit and supportive acidity. Black licorice and spiced plum are given additional richness by a jolt of dark chocolate.',\n",
       " 'With a fruity exuberance of crisp cranberry and red cherry, this wine delights in touches of nuanced herb and earth. Light bodied and refreshing, it maintains elegant complexity and depth, a lovely example of site and winemaking.',\n",
       " 'Earthy aromas of turned soil meet with dark red currant and a layer of smoke on the nose of this estate bottling by the historic vineyard. Strawberry, smoked pork and a touch of lavender show on the sip, which rides a strong acidity that arises in the midpalate and persists deep into the finish.',\n",
       " 'Very roasted notes of coffee, warm leather, tobacco leaves, sagebrush and stewed blackberries show on the nose of this blend of 70% Tempranillo, 20% Grenache and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. The roasted quality carries through the sip, with more coffee and char tones alongside dried plums, crushed gravel and dusty tannins.',\n",
       " 'This new project focusing on specific blocks of the historic Cambria Vineyard on the Santa Maria Bench starts with very subtle and restrained aromas of nectarine, lemon cream and a hint of grapefruit pith. The palate is fresh with lime and toasted coconut flavors, held up by a backbone of strong acid that keeps it from spilling toward overripe qualities.',\n",
       " \"Here is a solid, widely distributed, well-priced, all-purpose Chardonnay. It's got plenty of buttery toast, soft and round fruit—lightly peachy—and unusual richness for a wine in this price range. It's a California style with a Washington twist—real acid.\",\n",
       " \"Tasted at the age of 38 months, Erba's Bordeaux blend is a dense, tannicly dry wine. It has well-ripened flavors of blackberries, currants, mocha and cedar. If you drink it now, decant. Best before 2011, before the fruit falls out.\",\n",
       " 'A polished, supple Cabernet with real class and style. Drily tannic, it shows a good core of cherries, violets and herbs. Drink soon.',\n",
       " \"This superpremium effort from Precept Brands is loaded with fruit, and crafted with winemaker Charlie Hoppes' trademark style—lush oak, giving generous barrel flavors of butterscotch and toast. The barrel flavors dominate, complemented by bold black cherry, blackberry and cassis fruit.\",\n",
       " 'Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated, the blend also includes about one third Merlot and a splash of Syrah. Tight and somewhat reductive when first opened, it slowly unwraps into a substantial effort, dense with berry, cherry and cassis concentrate. Some not-quite-integrated green tannins remain, and the buttery finish also wants more bottle age. But a good effort overall.',\n",
       " 'The blend includes 6% Pinot Gris. This is a crisp, well-crafted bottle of wine, with more flesh and fruit than the Pine & Post Chardonnay from Precept Brands. Melon, pear, and orange fruit is accented with a little honey; this is a big step forward for this brand.',\n",

       " 'Much of the fruit for this wine came from Alexander Valley and it represents the appellation well, combining the ability to be juicy and approachable with powerful tannins and the potential to age. Cassis, raspberry and black pepper are standout characteristics, and the wine is big, but balanced.',\n",

       " \"The sixteenth edition of Dunham's benchmark Cabernet Sauvignon bears a strong scent of new oak—it's aged in 70% French and 30% American.

The Red Mountain fruit contributes characteristic notes of iron ore and underlying minerality.',\n",
       " \"Coming on the heels of the extraordinary 2009 vintage, this '10 is a worthy followup. It's bone dry, tannic and enormously complex, offering waves of blackberry, currant, cola, new oak and spice flavors. It's so good now, you may not want to cellar it, but try. It will begin to approach its peak after 2017.\",\n",

On the plus side is enormous  cassis, cherry and chocolate fruit flavor and rich, fine tannins, and the 100% new oak seems proper given the wine's volume. But there's too much sugary sweetness in the finish, almost like a dessert wine.\",\n",

Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious.

       " 'Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal. Its intense energy is a little wound up now, but will blossom with time.',\n",
       " 'The aging program for this Syrah, which comes from a vineyard near the intersection of the Carmel and Salinas valleys, results in a solidly balanced wine.

The flavors are light and lively with tart, racy acidity and a long, lingering finish.',\n",
       " \"A deep, dark color, unusually ripe and exotic aromas, and intense flavors recalling boysenberry syrup make this a monster Zin. It's not very tannic or astringent, but the body is so rich and the alcohol relatively high that it oozes power and concentration. This will be great after a meal with cheese or chocolate.\",\n",
       " 'This barrel-fermented wine has opulent aromas of nougat, butterscotch and pear tart. Equally interesting flavors stress the spice and pastry notes rather than straightforward fruitiness. It is attractively rich in mouth feel, dry, full-bodied and grand in style.',\n",

       " 'A very deep red color catches the attention. Next, strong, wild aromas like smoke and black rubber lead to a rather fruity but still firm and tannic texture. The flavors are more like blackberries and blueberries, but the overall effect is slightly viscous.',\n",
       " 'Dark, dry and puckering with a stewed plum aroma and flavor, this wine offers a depth of tannin and herbal notes. A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 8% Merlot, it spent 20 months in French oak.',\n",
       " \"This Southern Rhône-style blend is roughly half Mourvèdre, 31% Grenache and 17% Cinsault.

The wine has a spine of steel, suggesting it will age through 20206–2022.\",\n",
       " \"This is a über aromatic wine with a long list of notes that include orange marmalade, peach, citrus, and drizzled honey. Harvested at 42 brix and retaining a whopping 240 g/L residual sugar, it's supremely rich and sweet with a lingering finish.\",\n",
       " \"The vineyard is famous for producing ripe, luscious Pinots stuffed with massive fruit. Many wineries have dipped into it over the years.

It should age well through 2020–2022.\",\n",
       " \"The vineyard is near if not entirely within the Arroyo Grande Valley appellation, and it shows that region's tannins, acidity and ripe, long hangtime flavors.

Give it until 2018–2019 in the cellar to gain traction.\",\n",
       " \"It's risky to suggest aging a California Chardonnay, but you'd do well to stash this away until sometime in 2015. Right now, the wine is all about brisk acidity, oak and fresh, ripe tropical fruit, orange and pear flavors. All those parts need time to come together.\",\n",

       " \"Since planting in 1997, Bucher Vineyard has been a renowned source of Pinot Noir for exceptional local wineries. Now the Bucher family is making their own wine, with good results.

Begin to enjoy it around 2018.\",\n",
       " 'This is pure Mourvèdre from three excellent Red Mountain sites: Heart of the Hill, Ciel du Cheval and Grand Rêve vineyards. Tart, stony raspberry fruit carries a hint of cured meat and straw. The wine displays excellent length and a delicious purity.',\n",
       " \"Coming in a sparkly package befitting its name, this boxed wine shows honeysuckle and pineapple on the nose. On the palate, green apple flesh and pink apple skins prove tart and ripe at the same time, though without tons of body or finish. It's a solid deal though!\",\n",
       " 'Lots of stone fruit ripeness marks the nose of this wine, with aomas of nectarine and peach cut by the sharpness of apple skins. The palate is all green apples and lime juice.',\n",

       " 'A bit disjointed, with acidity sticking out, and the fruit tending toward jammy blackberries, raspberries and nectarines, leading to sharpness in the finish. Could mellow and improve in a couple years.',\n",
       " 'A good Cab, chockful of grilled blackberry, cassis, cocoa and sweet smoky oak flavors that finish rich and spicy. Has some real elegance, at an affordable price.',\n",
       " 'Rich, savory and appealing now for its smooth texture and forward flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries and oak. A lovely wine for grilled steaks and chops.',\n",
       " \"Andy Beckstoffer is starting to release wines from his Red Hills vineyards, and this release is promising, especially at this price. It's fruity and tasty in blackberries and cherries, while oak adds rich notes of caramel and vanilla. Rich and savory, this Cab delivers lots to like.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a lusty, rugged Zinfandel marked by strong, superripe flavors. The blackberries and plums veer into currants and raisins, and finish spicy and dry, while enormously high alcohol gives the impression of heat. But that's Zinfandel for you. Needs a grilled flank steak to play against.\",\n",
       " \"Made in a lighter style, this silky Pinot Noir has crisp acidity accentuating flavors of cherries, red licorice and cola. It's an elegant wine for drinking now.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a big, bold Zinfandel that shows the variety's rustic, briary character. It's dry and tannic and rather high in alcohol, with flavors of wild, ripe forest berries, peppery spices, currants, bacon and sweet, smoky cedar. Nice now with BBQ.\",\n",
       " \"Rich in fruit and oak, but balanced with crisp acidity. It's strongly flavored, brimming with pineapple jam, white peach, apricot, buttered toast and vanilla. Gets the Chardonnay job done with some elegance.\",\n",
       " \"A very nice Bordeaux-style blend ready to drink now. It's soft, dry and complex, offering waves of blackberries, black currants, blueberries, cedar and herbs, wrapped into fine, rich tannins.\",\n",
       " \"Sweet-pea and citrus flavors are pleasant, along with a welcome touch of creamy oak for richness. But there's also hints of green, unripe fruit in this dry, crisp Sauvignon Blanc.\",\n",
       " \"This blend of undisclosed varieties is a charming red wine to drink now. It's dry, smooth and ripe in blackberry, cherry, currant and spice flavors. Beef is its natural partner.\",\n",
       " \"There is loads of freshly crushed black pepper in this dry, robust Zin. It's almost enough to make you sneeze. You'll also find good blackberry fruit and heady alcohol. Drink up.\",\n",
       " 'Light to the point of being a bit dilute, this Viognier has a cotton-candy character, like spun sugar around rhubarb. The tart, not quite fully ripe fruit brings it to a quick, acidic finish.',\n",
       " \"Aged mostly in stainless steel with a touch of new French oak (10%), this has notes of toast and char along with freshly cut mango. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied, drinking just a hair off dry with a bitter note on the finish.\",\n",
       " \"This is a rustic but likeable wine. It's dry, tannic and full-bodied, with good varietal flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and sweet, smoky oak. Drink soon.\",\n",
       " 'This meaty, oaky Sauvignon Blanc, with a trace of Semillon, is slightly bitter with grassy and lemony aromas and flavors coming to the fore.',\n",
       " \"A common, country-style wine, rich in cherries, cola and spices, with lusty tannins. It's lush and simple, but will rise to the occasion with a cheeseburger. The blend is Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Graciano.\",\n",
       " 'Very ripe and extracted, just oozing the flavors of melted blackberry jam, black raspberry purée and milk chocolate. A bit sweet, but saved by firm tannins.',\n",
       " \"The fruit scents explode from the glass, showing raspberries, blueberries, cherries and plums in profusion. There is more stuffing, especially apparent in the nose and also in the mouth, than in the winery's varietal blends. The back end of the wine suggests bread and chocolate, light hints of toasted almond and cinnamon spice.\",\n",
       " \"Compared to Highlands' regular Cab, this is a great example of sometimes, more is less. The '06 Reserve is a gigantic wine, both in ripely extracted currants and in the taste of new, smoky oak. But it's very size makes it ponderous. The question is one of ageability. It could well be a sleeper. Try beyond 2010.\",\n",
       " 'This big, buttery Chardonnay will especially appeal to those who like California-style flavors; here enhanced with the firm acids characteristic of Washington State. There is a generous streak of vanilla cream, a soft and very buttery mouthfeel, yet the fruit has enough precision and focus that the wine does not lose definition. Delicious now, this is a wine to drink over the next three or four years.',\n",
       " \"Negociant Hughes continues to produce compelling wines at everyday prices. This Syrah, from one of Napa Valley's best mountain regions, is dry and thick in refined tannins. But it's so rich in black currants, black cherries, chocolate, pepper and sweet, smoky oak that it's delicious now.\",\n",
       " \"Here's a strongly flavored Merlot, made with ultraripe fruit. If it didn't have a good structure, the blackberry, currant, mocha and anise flavors alone would make it a fruit bomb. Fortunately, fine acidity and gorgeously thick tannins give it structure and backbone. Best for a year or two.\",\n",
       " 'Ripe, fruity and delicious. Flatters with deep, long flavors of blackberries, black currants, cassis and cedar, with a lush, tannic mouthfeel and long finish. Nice now, and should develop beyond 2012.',\n",
       " 'Lemon and herb aromas suggest a lean, crisp wine but the flavors are fairly ripe and the texture is rich and soft. Appley, floral and not at all tart, this is pleasant to sip.',\n",
       " \"Light aromas of passion fruit and grapefruit are followed by tropical flavors that linger. It's an easy drinking quaffer.\",\n",
       " \"Vivid plum and prune aromas and flavors define this generous and rather soft-textured wine. The fruit component is so rich it's jammy, and the tannins are very mild. The overall effect is grapy, almost sweet.\",\n",
       " 'This airy confection has aromas of lemon and vanilla, then almost sweet flavors of butterscotch and lemon cream on a fairly soft texture. It is light to medium bodied.',\n",
       " \"Hints of dusty mineral, nut and spice lend a savory tone to apple and pear in this cutting, crisp Riesling. It's honed and steely on the palate, finishing on a reverberating and bitter lime-zest note.\",\n",
       " 'Lighter in color and body than many counterparts, this wine presents a sour blackberry and woody herb nose. Black olives, elderberries, cedar and black pepper beef flavors show on the gravelly palate.',\n",
       " 'Reserved aromas of spice, pear and lychee are followed by medium-sweet flavors. Pair it with yellow curry.',\n",
       " 'Low in oak and high in acidity, this wine skews tart and high-strung in terms of citrus and wet stone-like notions, offering a bouquet of lemon chiffon. A nice entry and finish surround a less-intriguing middle.',\n",
       " \"This doesn't taste true to the grape variety, but it's a good white wine with orange peel, jasmine and tangerine aromas, fairly quiet fruit flavors and then a floral, citrus finish. Light to medium bodied, it has an appetizing texture.\",\n",
       " 'Light aromas of herbs, woodspice, tire rubber and red fruit lead to jammy raspberry and spice flavors that provide easy drinking pleasure.',\n",
       " 'Buoyantly aromatic, this blossomy Traminette sparkling wine stands out in a line up of traditional Champagne-style sparklers. Heady rose and gardenia tones feel perfumey on the palate, but brisk acidity and soft, pillowy foam are pleasant.',\n",
       " 'A soft-textured, rather light-bodied and fruit-forward offering, this smells and tastes like pear, apple and grape juices with a touch of sweetness and low acidity.',\n",
       " 'A rich texture and rather ripe fruit flavors make this softer and broader in taste than many of its peers. Flavors like Fuji apple and Bartlett pear are appealing, and the mouthfeel is smooth and easy rather than crisp.',\n",
       " 'Fresh peach and light floral aromas lead to ripe, grapey flavors and a soft, soothing texture in this medium-bodied wine. It is smooth and low in acid, with a charming flowery element that helps it stand out.',\n",
       " 'Made by an Oregon winery from Carneros region grapes, this wine tastes mellow and mature. It has a relatively light color with an auburn rim, aromas that are savory and meaty, flavors like rhubarb and beef, a fairly crisp balance and smooth texture.',\n",
       " 'Herb, currant, vanilla and tire-rubber aromas are at the fore. The blackberry flavors drink off dry, sweetening toward the finish.',\n",
       " 'Fresh in zingy, ripe blackberry flavor, this well-made Zin has firm tannins and a dollop of peppery spice on the finish.',\n",
       " 'Enticing and idiosyncratic on the nose, this Merlot offers notes of rose petal, smoke, blood orange and caraway seed. The palate is medium bodied and the 13% alcohol gives it a sense of finesse. Fine but firm tannins frame the cherry fruit, and it finishes with hints of maduro and rose.',\n",
       " \"There's lots of rich Chardonnay character in this affordable wine. It's rich with vanilla, buttered toast, honey, orange and pineapple-jam flavors, with brisk acidity providing balance. Great price for a Chard this good.\",\n",
       " \"This Pinot starts out tight, but after some time in the glass opens up to reveal black raspberry, mushroom, cola and exotic spice notes. It's dry, yet silky, in the mouth. A pretty wine, and for the price, a comparative bargain.\",\n",
       " \"Impressive for its power, a wine of considerable interest and complexity. It's rich in black cherries, red currants, cola, bacon and spice flavors, but the texture really stands up, a combination of firm tannins and brilliant acidity. Oak provides complicating notes of sweet toast. Drink soon.\",\n",
       " 'Perfumed in cinnamon-flowery aromatics, this well-valued Zin is softly spiced, lush and smooth, drinkable with black cherry flavor and plenty of personality.',\n",
       " \"This is the ideal anti-Chardonnay white wine. There's no oak at all to interfere with the lemon, lime and mineral flavors, and the acidity is brisk and mouthwatering. A dry, crisply brilliant wine to drink now with everything from sushi to tuna tartare.\",\n",
       " \"Intensely concentrated in black currants, cassis liqueur and oak aromas and flavors, this Cabernet is so strong, it's practically undrinkable now. It's not just the potent tannins and bright acidity, it's the raw, jammy quality of the fruit. All these elements could begin to come together after 2017.\",\n",
       " \"Spicy red currant fruit comes up quickly, backed with the grape's signature accents of stem and earth. There's a residual flavor of slightly bitter tomato leaf.\",\n",
       " \"This is the winery's Left-Bank-Bordeaux-style blend, three quarters Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a pleasing mix of red and black fruits, licorice, toast and smoke, and spent two and a half years in French oak, 60% new. The wine is quite tasty and drinking well, though the blend lacks focus.\",\n",
       " \"Don't let the label mislead you; this is not a dessert wine. It's off-dry, with a pretty suite of lemon, orange and citrus peel flavors. A whiff of tea runs through the aromas, and a bit of lemon oil in the finish.\",\n",
       " 'The top cuvée from Mercer Estates, this reserve is a Bordeaux-style blend based upon 64% Merlot, the rest a mix of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A firm entry introduces a solid mid-palate with a mix of black fruits, coffee and toast. The finish is clean and gentle, with moderate persistence.',\n",
       " 'This young, stainless steel-fermented Chardonnay has a beery hoppiness to the aromas, leading into a tart, juicy and crisp palate of lime and grapefruit. The acids taste of wet stone, and that vivid minerality brings dimension and lift to the finish.',\n",
       " 'This wine is abundant with aromas of cherry Coke, sarsaparilla and baking spice. The palate is delicate yet is given some weight from seven months in neutral French and American oak. This wine gains a soft texture from Tannat skins added during fermentation.',\n",
       " 'This neon-watermelon sparkler shows playfully fruity aromas of watermelon hard candy and fresh strawberries. Ample acidity keeps the palate lively, with ripe watermelon, cherry and strawberry flavors carrying through to the bright finish.',\n",
       " 'Quite sweet and quite delicious, this ripe and fruity wine has lots of black plum, dried cherry and raisin flavors, a soft texture and a lingering, berry-pie finish.',\n",
       " 'This pleasant, easy-drinking wine from five different Pinot Noir clones mixes citrus and berry flavors. It was aged in 30% new oak and is nicely balanced, with firm acidity.',\n",
       " 'This late release sourced from several vineyards dating back to the 1970s and 1980s is thin on the palate, with tart plum, herb, orange peel and of pineapple hints. Low alcohol reflects the cool vintage.',\n",
       " \"Made in the style of a southern Rhône blend (half Viognier and one quarter each Marsanne and Roussanne), this is lightly lemony, with a bit more fat in the middle. None of the three grapes overpowers the others, but the flavors feel a bit generic. Though fermented in stainless steel, it's gold in color and shows some hints of toast.\",\n",
       " \"Exceptionally light, this acid-driven wine is all flowers and green apple, with just the slightest reach out to honeycomb-like texture and weight. It'll do well at the table in its unfussy approach and crispness.\",\n",
       " 'Woody oak shows the 50% barrel fermentation behind this wine, sourced largely from the Dry Creek Valley. Baked apple and vanilla cream accent a thickly concentrated frame of big flavor and soft lush texture.',\n",
       " 'Made from 100% Chardonnay, this shows lemon, apple and nectarine on the nose with hints of croisant. Spritely bubbles quickly fade, leaving honeydew, green apple, nectarine and a hint of pastry. The finish is fresh with lemon juice and tart apple.',\n",
       " 'This is weighty, creamy and medium to full in body. It has plenty of lime and pear flavors, plus slight brown sugar and vanilla notes.',\n",
       " 'Made from Roussanne, Viognier and other Rhône varieties, this blend is dry, soft and heavy. But it is flavorful, offering waves of apricots, peaches and coconut-tinged macaroons.',\n",

       " \"Rich and substantial, this is potent in blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors. High alcohol gives it a hot mouthfeel. It's not really representative of the Arrowood name of old.\",\n",
       " 'Tart and dry, this has a broad flavor that does not express much varietal specificity, with some notes of caramel and butter. Not yet knit together, this could improve significantly with further bottle age.',\n",
       " 'A big, heavy rosé, this has an orange-pink color and slightly sweet flavors of jammy raspberry, vanilla and cream. A blend of Syrah and Grenache.',\n",
       " \"The Dion is a new entry in the long list of Erath single-vineyard wines. It doesn't show much in this difficult vintage. Short and intensely herbal, it has strong scents and flavors of tomato leaf, which override any hint of ripe fruit flavor.\",\n",
       " \"It's difficult to understand what this is trying to be. Pinot Gris can show some light blush color, but this wine is almost pink. The result is tannic and tart, with a rhubarb-like flavor.\",\n",
       " 'This delivers great Pinot-like character for its price tier. Give it credit for the dry silkiness, clean acidity and vibrant cherry, cola and oak flavors.',\n",
       " \"This demonstrates Viognier's typical full, fleshy, intensely flavored palate, with tropical flavors of kiwi and bitter papaya seed, plus an ultraripe note of honeydew and a hint of flower.\",\n",
       " 'Soft and sexy, this small-production Pinot is made from Swan-clone grapes exclusively, which provides an intriguing spiciness to the wine. Amid the spice is a brambly taste of blackberry and blueberry, layered and juicy on the palate, the tannins well-ingrained through the finish.',\n",
       " 'This very approachable and likable wine puts the typical dried-grass aromas atop stone fruit scents. The palate is very herb-tinged, with parsley, thyme and rosemary finding a nice symbiosis with the riper nectarine and melon flesh.',\n",
       " 'Supple and accessible, this Cabernet is bright in acidity and soft in tannins, yet amply structured. The palate is layered with flavors of cherry and cranberry, with a hit of nuanced oak on the finish.',\n",
       " \"This is the first vintage made by the vineyard owners in 25 years, a welcome return for one of the founding families of Oregon viticulture. Strawberries and raspberries, tart and spicy, anchor an elegant and interesting young wine. The finish continues clean and well-defined. Don't look for a blockbuster style; rather it's more delicate and refined.\",\n",
       " \"There's an earthy intensity to this reserve wine, generous in oak and cedar notes with complicated, concentrated mix of plum, cherry and berry. Nonetheless, the wine intrigues and delights.\",\n",
       " 'This wine delivers on richness of flavor without being overwhelming or overdone. Refined in soft tannins and a core of expressive, juicy blue and black berry fruit, it is seductive and smoky on the finish, sourced mainly from vineyards in the Dry Creek Valley.',\n",
       " \"Lithe and dancing in texture, yet robustly concentrated with yellow peach and cherry flavors, Red Newt's Circle delivers great quality for a gentle price, vintage after vintage. Off dry in style, it's zesty and bright, finishing long with a fresh herbal edge.\",\n",
       " 'Serious and concentrated, this is a big and bold wine packed with ripe fruit flavors and firm tannins. It smells oaky and smoky, tastes rich with blackberry and dark chocolate and feels appropriately astringent, dry and full-bodied. Drinkable now, it will be best after 2017.',\n",
       " 'Cola, dark red fruit, black pepper and oak greet the nose on this blend of 77% Grenache, 19% Syrah and 4% Mourvèdre. The palate is quite structured with firm tannins that could use some mellowing, with flavors of roasted pork, blackberry and prevalent cedar.',\n",
       " \"This wine is a blend of Upland Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (50%), Double Canyon Petit Verdot (38%) and McKinley Springs Malbec. It's aromatically reserved, revealing fresh and dried herbs, green pepper, vanilla, cocoa and dark cherry. The dark fruit flavors show a very pretty combination of richness and restraint.\",\n",
       " \"You'd swear this 100% varietal wine had some Viognier in it, but the orange-peel aromas and flavors are just a hallmark of Yakima Valley fruit. It also features abundant cranberry, mulberry, rose hip and savory notes. The supple feel with light meat accents is where this wine really shines, showing purity, texture and a lot of elegance. Those looking for big fruit, look elsewhere.\",\n",
       " 'Aged for 30 months in French and American oak (90% new), this wine brings pleasing notes of café au lait, pencil lead, cashew and woodspice. Rich coffee and chocolate flavors are backed by a silky feel, with the wood playing prominent role.',\n",
       " \"Like a lemon-cream pastry in a bottle, this low-yield, hillside-grown wine has buttery, creamy aromas, rich almond and bright lemon flavors and a soft, nearly sweet finish. Not too full-bodied, it's a bit lighter in texture than many, because of that fresh lemony acidity to buoy it up.\",\n",
       " 'This strikes a good balance between spicy oak, fruitiness and firm texture. It smells lightly spicy from oak barrels, and also fresh like red cherry and sweet plums. Rich and layered in feel, it finishes dry and full bodied. Not overblown, it has just the right mix of elements for the dinner table.',\n",
       " \"This energized white wine has a German accent. Aromas recall honey, honeysuckle, tart apple and pineapple, and the flavors are like orange zest—tart, crisp and slightly bitter in a good way. This blend of Kerner, Gewürztraminer, Riesling and Bacchus grapes should be brilliant with rich shellfish. It was barrel-fermented in 60% new oak, which one can't so much taste as feel subtly.\",\n",
       " 'The color of decades-aged Chardonnay, medium-to-dark straw, this dessert wine is rich in toasted almonds and hazelnuts, with secondary flavors of baked apple and stone fruit. Mouthfillingly rich, it remains balanced and complex, lingering on the finish in baking spices.',\n",

       " 'Deftly calibrating sultry black fruit against savory earth tones, this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc offers refinement. Toast, smoke and bramble integrate amid black plum and cherry flavors. The finish is powerful and persistent, fringed with finely grained tannins.',\n",

       " \"Coming from one of the appellation's most consistent producers, this offers a tight, restrained nose of blackberry and licorice. It's also tight and bright on the palate, with refreshing flavors of black cherries and crushed rocks. An expert balance of tannins and acidity gives the mouth a clean wash.\",\n",
       " 'Extra dark in color, this has equally attention-getting dark chocolate and espresso aromas, rich black currant and blackberry flavors, and a firm, generously tannic texture. Although tempting to drink now, this will improve in complexity and smoothness through 2017.',\n",

       " \"A single vineyard expression from this winery's newish vineyard, this shows pressed purple flowers, deep blueberries and a touch of tar on the nose. The flavors are dense, dark and framed by strong tannins, with elderberry, pencil lead and deep lilac syrup gaining intrigue from white sage, white pepper and raw beef tones.\",\n",
       " 'Lots of fresh apple flavors, a crisp balance and smooth mouthfeel make this light-bodied wine refreshing and fun to drink. It has some richness on the midpalate and finish, but basically keeps its lively, tangy personality going.',\n",
       " 'Sharp aromas of peach blossoms, honeyed nuts and lemon balm make for a fruity yet biting nose on this blend of 58% Grenache Blanc from Happy Canyon and 42% Viognier from San Luis Obispo County. Ripened stonefruit flavors are cut with a sizzle of acidity and warmth of sea salt and candied Meyer lemon on the palate.',\n",
       " \"A clear, light-bodied wine that's slightly reduced on the nose, this Spring Mountain site provides a tightness of black tea and cherry cola, with a leanness that's hard to miss. Leather, currant and baked bread add additional complexity and intrigue.\",\n",
       " 'A 100% varietal wine entirely from Yountville, this presents a touch of herb and cedar on the entry aromatically, followed by a thickness of tannin that softens in the glass. Big-boned, it finishes strong in tobacco and coffee.',\n",
