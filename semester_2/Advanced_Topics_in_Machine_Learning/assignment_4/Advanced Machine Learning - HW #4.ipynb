       " 'One of the first 1999 Cabs on the market, this wine smells and tastes like the grapes were crushed yesterday. This is what middleweight Cabernet Sauvignon sans oak tastes like: all fresh blackberries and cherries, with undercurrants of espresso and sweet spice. A remarkably tasty wine that should be easy to find: There were 65,000 cases produced.',\n",
       " 'Redolent of sweet plum compote, this semidry Missouri rosé made from native Catawba grapes is an interesting alternative for White Zin fans. Full bodied, with a slightly sugary palate, it finishes with a hint of that foxy Catawba musk. Drink now.',\n",

Peach, grapefruit, apple and spice notes are at the core here, followed by a lemony fresh finish. Quite fruity in style and fairly sweet. Try it as an aperitif or with duck and sweet sauces.',\n",
       " 'Raised in stainless steel, without oak infuence, this wine is rich, savory and dry. A small percentage of Pinot Grigio brings a note of green apple to the flavors of citrus, white flower and honey.',\n",
       " \"Lovely and fresh, this piles on flavors of Bosc pear, with the texture to match. It's a wonderful expression of the grape coming from the eastern Washington region, accented with lovely, delicate baking spices.\",\n",
       " 'Sugared plum, spice, vanilla and herb aromas are followed by off-dry, soft blue-fruit flavors in this wine. It provides easy-drinking pleasure.',\n",
       " \"This great-value SB from Lake County hits it out of the park on all sorts of fronts, including price. It's got subtle aromatics of pear and lemon, and is a little generic and simple, but at $10 it's so perfectly drinkable who cares? All in a colorful package. Best Buy.\",\n",
       " 'Soft and simple, but the price makes it a pretty good value. Shows cherry, violet, cocoa and smoky oak flavors in a smooth package that finishes dry and spicy.',\n",
       " 'Savory rather than simply fruity flavors are the strong point of this medium-bodied and well-balanced wine. It tastes almost like melon wrapped in prosciutto as meaty, earthy nuances blend with modest fruit accents.',\n",
       " 'Raw and fresh, with jammy mulberry, blackberry and pepper flavors. A rustic wine for rustic food.',\n",
       " 'Simple and silky, this is fairly sweet in apricot and raspberry fruit. This is easy to drink at picnics and similar everyday occasions.',\n",
       " 'Tasty touches of toasted oak, butter and almonds in the aroma and again in the flavor add depth to the ripe Anjou pear notes in this full-bodied, posh-textured wine. With all that flavor, it keeps its balance and has a lingering finish, too.',\n",
       " \"Dry and gritty, with rugged tannins and lots of acidity. Unfortunately, the fruit just isn't powerful enough to stand up to it, making this Merlot tough to like.\",\n",
